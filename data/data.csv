While the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease overlap with those of other conditions, an accurate diagnosis typically relies on extensive neurological, psychiatric, and physical examinations. Consequently, numerous autonomous diagnostic assistance systems, based on machine learning (ML) methodologies, have emerged to assist in evaluating patients with PD. This work proposes a novel deep learning-based classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) using voice recordings of people into normal, idiopathic Parkinson, and familial Parkinson. The improved jellyfish algorithm (IJFA) is utilized for hyper-parameter selection (HPS) of a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). The proposed technique makes use of the significant elements of 1D-CNN and filter-based feature selection models. Because of their strong performance in dealing with noisy data, the filter-based algorithms Relief, mRMR, and Fisher Score were chosen as the top choices. Using just 62 characteristics, the combination of deep relief features and deep learning was able to discriminate between people. The competence of the proposed 1D-CNN with IJFA method was determined through specific network metrics. The proposed 1D-CNN with IJFA method attains a total accuracy of 98.6%, which is comparatively better than the existing techniques. The proposed model produced around 9.5% improvements in accuracy, respectively, when compared to the data obtained without dimensionality reduction.",IC,

The goal is to improve diagnostics and enable remote monitoring through machine learning models.,"Medical diagnostic methods that utilise modalities of patient symptoms such as speech are increasingly being used for initial diagnostic purposes and monitoring disease state progression. Speech disorders are particularly prevalent in neurological degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, the focus of the study undertaken in this work. We will demonstrate state-of-the-art statistical time-series methods that combine elements of statistical time series modelling and signal processing with modern machine learning methods based on Gaussian process models to develop methods to accurately detect a core symptom of speech disorder in individuals who have Parkinson's disease. We will show that the proposed methods out-perform standard best practices of speech diagnostics in detecting ataxic speech disorders, and we will focus the study, particularly on a detailed analysis of a well regarded Parkinson's data speech study publicly available making all our results reproducible. The methodology developed is based on a specialised technique not widely adopted in medical statistics that found great success in other domains such as signal processing, seismology, speech analysis and ecology. In this work, we will present this method from a statistical perspective and generalise it to a stochastic model, which will be used to design a test for speech disorders when applied to speech time series signals. As such, this work is making contributions both of a practical and statistical methodological nature.",IC,

with PT, due to frequency content overlap of both signals. Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is used for the
clinical assessment of PD. It considers the forms filled out with patients’ symptoms information and their physical
evaluation. This scale is subjective due to the inter-rater variability, justifying the aim of the present work of
developing a methodology to distinguish these three disorders. Thus, five machine learning algorithms - K-
Nearest Neighbours (K-NN), Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest (RF), Naïve Bayes (NB) and Support Vector
Machines (SVM) - were chosen for classification purposes. First, variables were extracted from the collected
signals (mean, standard deviation, and amplitude peak in time; dominant and second dominant frequencies; first
and second spectral peaks; correlation peak and instant time of it). Next, a Principal Component Analysis was
carried out for reducing the data set to three components that explained 95% of the data variance, which were

FoG often results in falls and negatively affect a patient’s quality

detect FoG events using signals derived from wearable sensors.
However, predicting FoG before it actually occurs opens the
possibility of preemptive cueing, which can potentially avoid (or
reduce the intensity and duration of) the episodes. Moreover,
human gait involves signi?cant subject-based variability and a
machine learning model trained on a particular patient’s data
may not generalize well to other patients. In this paper, we study
the performance of advanced deep learning algorithms to predict
FoG events in short time durations before their occurrence.
We further study the performance of domain adaptation (or
transfer learning) algorithms to address the domain disparity
between data from different subjects, in order to develop a
better prediction model for a particular subject. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ?rst research effort to study domain
adaptation algorithms to predict FoG episodes in patients with

and vocal sounds, better known as tics. Cases of mild Tourette can have tics numerous times throughout the day, while severe
cases may have tics every 5 to 10 seconds. At certain times, typically during high levels of stress, tics become chained in an
incessant, continuous fashion—this is known as a tic attack. Tic attacks incapacitate the patient, rendering it difficult for them to
move, perform daily actions, and even communicate with others. Caretakers—usually guardians, family members, or nurses—can
help reduce the time tic attacks last with their presence and by providing emotional support to the patient.
Objective: We describe TSBand, a wearable wristband that uses machine learning algorithms and a variety of sensors to monitor
for tic attacks and notify caretakers when an attack occurs.
Methods: We conducted a research survey with 70 Tourette patients to determine the usability and functionality of TSBand;
internal review board approval was not required.
Results: This study has resulted in a smart wristband prototype that costs US $62.74; it uses movement, heart rate, sweat, and
body temperature to detect tic attacks using a hybrid local outlier factoring and regression algorithm. An audio tic attack detection
mechanism is also included, using recurrent neural networks, and a manually activated backup button and backup audio mechanism
are fitted to alert caretakers on the personalized companion app.
Conclusions: TSBand enables the caretaker to provide support faster and prevent excessive self-harm or injury during the attack.
It is an affordable and effective solution, solving a problem that many Tourette patients, often children, face. This study has not
had the opportunity to test TSBand with any Tourette patients, and we aim to perform rigorous testing and analysis after grant
funding is secured.",NC,

Imaging markers are objective and sensitive for early diagnosis but are costly and not commonly available. The video-based movement measures estimated using AI algorithms for motion tracking represent a novel alternative for diagnosing and assessing PD. Video-based measures are objective, sensitive to small changes, inexpensive, and easily accessible. This paper explores the correlation between objective kinematic measures derived from videos of the Finger Tapping Test using AI-based algorithms for markerless motion tracking with well-established clinical and imaging markers of disease progression in PD. The results demonstrate that AI-based algorithms for markerless motion tracking accurately track hand movements during the Finger Tapping Test, quantifying speed, duration, amplitude, and rhythm alterations.

In this paper a novel approach has been proposed to diagnose PD using the gait analysis, that consists of the gait cycle, which can be broken down into various phases and periods to determine normative and abnormal gait. Initially, the raw force data obtained from physionet database was filtered using a Chebyshev type II high pass filter with a cut-off frequency 0.8 Hz to remove noises arising from the changes in orientation of the subject's body and other factors during measurement. The filtered data was used for extracting various gait features using the peak detection and pulse duration measuring techniques. The threshold values of the gait detection algorithm were tuned to individual subjects. From the peak detection algorithm, various kinetic features including the heel and toe forces, and their normalized values were obtained. The pulse duration algorithm was developed to extract different temporal features including the stance and swing phases, and stride time. Tremor is a common symptom in PD. Tremor is an involuntary movement of body parts. At first the tremor may appear in a specific body part like an arm, leg or one side of the body and later it may spread to both sides. This rest tremor is a cardinal sign of PD. An average accuracy of 92.7% is achieved for the diagnosis of PD from gait analysis and tremor analysis is used for knowing the severity of PD.",IC,

removing each inflationary effect corresponded with a decrease in classification accuracy, and that removing
all inflationary effects reduced the evaluated performance by up to 30%. Additionally, the performance on a
more realistic test set increased, suggesting that the removal of these inflationary effects enabled the model to
better learn the underlying task and generalize. Source code is available at https://github.com/Wenbo-G/pdphonation-

disease (PD) is bradykinesia. Automated bradykinesia assessment
is critically needed for helping neurologists achieve objective
clinical diagnosis and hence provide timely and appropriate
medical services. This need has become especially urgent after the
outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in late 2019. Currently,
the main factor limiting the accurate assessment is the difficulty
of mining the fine-grained discriminative motion features.
Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive graph convolutional
network for automated and objective toe-tapping assessment,
which is one of the most important tests of lower-extremity
bradykinesia. Specifically, based on joint sequences extracted
from videos, a supervised contrastive learning strategy was
followed to cluster together the features of each class, thereby
enhancing the specificity of the learnt class-specific features.
Subsequently, a multi-stream joint sparse learning mechanism
was designed to eliminate potentially similar redundant features
of joint position and motion, hence strengthening the discriminability
of features extracted from different streams. Finally,
a spatial-temporal interaction graph convolutional module was
developed to explicitly model remote dependencies across time
and space, and hence boost the mining of fine-grained motion
features. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that
this method achieved remarkable classification performance on a
clinical video dataset, with an accuracy of 70.04% and an acceptable
accuracy of 98.70%. These results obviously outperformed
other existing sensor- and video-based methods. The proposed
video-based scheme provides a reliable and objective tool for
automated quantitative toe-tapping assessment, and is expected to
be a viable method for remote medical assessment and diagnosis",NC,

However, during early-stage PD, these symptoms are subtle and difficult to quantify by experts, which might
result in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal disease management.
Objective: To evaluate the use of videos and machine learning (ML) for automatic quantification of motor
symptoms in early-stage PD.
Methods: We analyzed videos of three movement tasks—Finger Tapping, Hand Movement, and Leg Agility—from
26 aged-matched healthy controls and 31 early-stage PD patients. Utilizing ML algorithms for pose estimation we
extracted kinematic features from these videos and trained three classification models based on left and rightside
movements, and right/left symmetry. The models were trained to differentiate healthy controls from
early-stage PD from videos.
Results: Combining left side, right side, and symmetry features resulted in a PD detection accuracy of 79 % from
Finger Tap videos, 75 % from Hand Movement videos, 79 % from Leg Agility videos, and 86 % when combining
the three tasks using a soft voting approach. In contrast, the classification accuracy varied between 40 % and 72
% when the movement side or symmetry were not considered.
Conclusions: Our methodology effectively differentiated between early-stage PD and healthy controls using videos
of standardized motor tasks by integrating kinematic analyses of left-side, right-side, and bilateral symmetry
movements. These results demonstrate that ML can detect movement deficits in early-stage PD from videos. This
technology is easy-to-use, highly scalable, and has the potential to improve the management and quantification
of motor symptoms in early-stage PD",NC,

We specifically investigate opti- mal feature selection and machine learning algorithms for these tasks. Methods: We selected 885 PD subjects as derived from longitudinal datasets (years 0–4; Parkinson's Progressive Marker Initiative), and investigated 981 features including motor, non-motor, and imaging features (SPECT-based radiomics features extracted using our standardized SERA software). Two different hybrid machine learning systems (HMLS) were constructed and applied to the data in order to select optimal combinations in both tasks: (i) identification of subtypes in PD (unsupervised-clustering), and (ii) prediction of these subtypes in year 4 (supervised-classification). From the original data based on years 0 (baseline) and 1, we created new datasets as inputs to the prediction task: (i,ii) CSD0 and CSD01: cross-sectional datasets from year 0 only and both years 0 & 1, respectively; (iii) TD01: timeless dataset from both years 0 & 1. In addition, PD subtype in year 4 was considered as outcome. Finally, high score features were derived via ensemble voting based on their prioritizations from feature selector algorithms (FSAs). Results: In clustering task, the most optimal combinations (out of 981) were selected by individual FSAs to enable high correlation compared to using all features (arriving at 547). In prediction task, we were able to select optimal combinations, resulting in an accuracy > 90% only for timeless dataset (TD01); there, we were able to select the most optimal combination using 77 features, directly selected by FSAs. In both tasks, however, using combination of only high score features from ensemble voting did not en- able acceptable performances, showing optimal feature selection via individual FSAs to be more effective. Conclusion: Combining non-imaging information with SPECT-based radiomics features, and optimal uti- lization of HMLSs, can enable robust identification of subtypes as well as appropriate prediction of these subtypes in PD patients. Moreover, use of timeless dataset, beyond cross-sectional datasets, enabled pre- dictive accuracies over 90%. Overall, we showed that radiomics features extracted from SPECT images are important in clustering as well as prediction of PD subtypes.",NC,

Preliminary data collection for the project began almost 10 years ago. The current study is nearing completion of its third year, and has aLogReady reported several novel and important results. First, surprisingly, at least 90% of children who had experienced tics for only a mean of 3 months still had tics at the 12-month anniversary of their first tic, though in some cases tics were seen only with remote video observation of the child sitting alone. Thus almost all of them now had a DSM-5 diagnosis of Tourette’s Disorder or Persistent (Chronic) Tic Disorder. Baseline clinical features that predicted 12-month outcome included tic severity, subsyndromal autism spectrum symptoms, an anxiety disorder, and a history of 3 or more phonic tics. Second, we found that poorer tic suppression ability when immediately rewarded for suppression predicted greater tic severity at follow-up. Third, striatal volumes did not predict outcome as hypothesized, but a larger hippocampus at baseline predicted worse severity at follow-up.

This study proposes a two-stage neural network model for the classifying the initial stages of PD using data recorded with smartphone sensors during a modified Timed Up & Go test. Methods: The proposed model consists on two stages: in the first stage, a semantic segmentation of the raw sensor signals classifies the activities included in the test and obtains biomechanical variables that are considered clinically relevant parameters for functional assessment. The second stage is a neural network with three input branches: one with the biomechanical variables, one with the spectrogram image of the sensor signals, and the third with the raw sensor signals. Results: This stage employs convolutional layers and long short-term memory.

Ataxia is a degenerative disease of the nervous system that surfaces as difficulty with motor control, such as walking imbalance. Previous studies have attempted automatic diagnosis of Ataxia with the help of wearable biomarkers, Kinect, and other sensors. These sensors, while accurate, do not scale efficiently well to naturalistic deployment settings. In this study, we propose a method for identifying ataxic symptoms by analyzing videos of participants walking down a hallway, captured with a standard monocular camera. In a collaboration with 11 medical sites located in 8 different states across the United States, we collected a dataset of 155 videos along with their severity rating from 89 participants (24 controls and 65 diagnosed with or are pre-manifest spinocerebellar ataxias). The participants performed the gait task of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose coordinates to capture gait characteristics such as step width, step length, swing, stability, speed, etc. Our system is able to identify and track a patient in complex scenarios. For example, if there are multiple people present in the video or an interruption from a passerby. Our Ataxia risk-prediction model achieves 83.06% accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score.

Through feature importance analysis, we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with greater Ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we are releasing the models and the body-pose coordinate dataset to the research community - the largest dataset on ataxic gait (to our knowledge). Our models could contribute to improving health access by enabling remote Ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings without requiring any sensors or special cameras.

However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies? Methodology: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. Conclusion: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions. However, with use of a significantly larger number of subjects than in prior work and clinically validated gait features, we were able to demonstrate that automatic patient classification based on smartphone sensor data can be used to objectively infer the severity of PD and the extent of specific gait anomalies.",IC,

cant and challenging task. Based on the representative action of finger tapping, this paper designs an automatic evaluation
method by deep learning technology to provide big data screening and preliminary evaluation for potential patients with PD.
Presently, doctors use the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(MDS-UPDRS) to assess the severity of patients. This method is time-consuming and laborious, and there are subjective
differences. The evaluation method based on sensor equipment is also widely used, but it is expensive and needs professional
guidance, which is not suitable for remote evaluation and patient self-examination. Additionally, it is difficult to collect
patient data for medical research, so it is important to find an objective and automatic assessment method for Parkinson's
dyskinesia based on small samples.
Methods In this study, we designed an automatic evaluation method combining manual features and convolutional neural
network (CNN) suitable for small sample classification. Based on the finger tapping video of Parkinson's patients, we used
the pose estimation model to obtain the action skeleton information and calculated the feature data. We then use the 5-folds
cross validation training model to achieve an optimum trade-off between bias and variance, and finally make a multi-class
prediction through fully connected network (FCN).
Results Our proposed method achieves the current optimal accuracy of 79.7% in this research. We have compared with
the latest methods of related research, and our method is superior to them in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and
floating point operations (FLOPs).
Conclusion The proposed method does not require patients to wear sensor devices and has clear advantages in providing
early screening and remote clinical evaluation for patients with PD. Simultaneously, the proposed method using motion
feature data to train the CNN model obtains the optimal accuracy, effectively solves the problem of limited data acquisition
in medicine and provides a novice proposal for a small sample size classification",NC,

Ma- chine learning (ML) techniques have been used in the early prediction of PD progression. Fusion of het- erogeneous data modalities proved its capability to improve the performance of ML models. Time series data fusion supports the tracking of the disease over time. In addition, the trustworthiness of the result- ing models is improved by adding model explainability features. The literature on PD has not sufficiently explored these three points. Methods: In this work, we proposed an ML pipeline for predicting the progression of PD that is both accurate and explainable. We explore the fusion of different combinations of five time series modalities from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) real-world dataset, including patient charac- teristics, biosamples, medication history, motor, and non-motor function data. Each patient has six visits. The problem has been formulated in two ways: ?a three-class based progression prediction with 953 patients in each time series modality, and ?a four-class based progression prediction with 1,060 pa- tients in each time series modality. The statistical features of these six visits were calculated from each modality and diverse feature selection methods were applied to select the most informative feature sets. The extracted features were used to train a set of well-known ML models including Support vector ma- chines (SVM), random forests (RF), extra tree classifier (ETC), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We examined a number of data-balancing strategies in the pipeline with different combinations of modalities. ML models have been optimized using the Bayesian optimizer. A comprehensive evaluation of various ML methods has been conducted, and the best models have been extended to provide different explainability features. Results: We compare the performance of ML models before and after optimization and using and with- out using feature selection. In the three-class experiment and with various modality fusions, the LGBM model produced the most accurate results with a 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) accuracy of 90.73% us- ing non-motor function modality. RF produced the best results in the four-class experiment with various modality fusions with a 10-CV accuracy of 94.57% using non-motor modality. With the fused dataset of non-motor and motor function modalities, the LGBM model outperformed the other ML models in both the 3-class and 4-class experiments (i.e., 10-CV accuracy of 94.89% and 93.73%, respectively). Using the Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework, we employed global and instance-based explanations to explain the behavior of each ML classifier. Moreover, we extended the explainability by implement- ing the LIME and SHAPASH local explainers. The consistency of these explainers has been explored. The resultant classifiers were accurate, explainable, and thus medically more relevant and applicable.",NC,

Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor (ET), and
Tourette’s syndrome (TS) patients.
Methods: Five PD, 2 ET, and 1 TS patient were

velocity and width, and step width variability. As to the PD stage identification, the Random Forest outperformed
the other studied ML algorithms, by reaching an Area Under the ROC curve of 0.786. We found two relevant gait

MDS-UPDRS assessment has been recently required as an
invaluable tool for PD diagnosis and telemedicine, especially with
the recent novel coronavirus pandemic outbreak. This paper proposes
a novel vision-based method for automated assessment of
the arising-from-chair task, which is one of the key MDS-UPDRS

strategy is proposed to construct a metric learning formulation

Afterwards, a vertex-specific convolution operation
is designed to achieve effective aggregation of all skeletal joint

representation supervised mechanism is developed to maximize
the potential consistency between the joint and bone information
streams. Experimental results on a clinical dataset demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed method over the existing sensorbased

achieving the video-based automated assessment of Parkinsonian hand movements, which represent a vital MDSUPDRS

are extracted from videos, and then the spatial structures of these skeletons are constructed through depth-first
tree traversal. Afterwards, a tree max-pooling module is employed to establish remote exchange between outer

Finally, a group-sparsity-induced momentum contrast is also developed to learn similar motion patterns under
different interference through contrastive learning. This can promote stable learning of discriminative spatialtemporal
features with invariant motion semantics. Comprehensive experiments on a large clinical video dataset

In this research, an ML approach is optimized with the use of Spatio-temporal data obtained from a kinect-sensor to differentiate between normal gait and ataxic. The current ML-based approaches perform very poorly because they cannot build feature-correlation among many gait characteristics. Furthermore, current ML-based techniques generate more false-positive whenever data is imbalanced in nature; especially for performing multi-label classification. This work presents a feature selection and ranking (FSR) based on extreme gradient boost (XGB) for ataxia severity classification. The FSR-XGB introduce an enhanced misclassification minimization error optimization and presents a novel feature selection and ranking to introduce feature importance using new cross-validation mechanism, both of which are aimed at solving the multilabel classification research problems.

well-established therapy for idiopathic/genetic dystonia, benefits for acquired dystonia
are varied, ranging from modest improvement to deterioration. Predictive biomarkers to
aid DBS prognosis for children are lacking, especially in acquired dystonias, such as
dystonic Cerebral Palsy. We explored the potential role of machine learning techniques
to identify parameters that could help predict DBS outcome.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 244 children attending King’s College
Hospital between September 2007 and June 2018 for neurophysiological tests as part
of their assessment for possible DBS at Evelina London Children’s Hospital. For the 133
individuals who underwent DBS and had 1-year outcome data available, we assessed
the potential predictive value of six patient parameters: sex, etiology (including cerebral
palsy), baseline severity (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-motor score),
cranial MRI and two neurophysiological tests, Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT)
and Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SEP). We applied machine learning analysis to
determine the best combination of these features to aid DBS prognosis. We developed
a classification algorithm based on Decision Trees (DTs) with k-fold cross validation for
independent testing. We analyzed all possible combinations of the six features and
focused on acquired dystonias.
Results: Several trees resulted in better accuracy than the majority class classifier.
However, the two features that consistently appeared in top 10 DTs were CMCT
and baseline dystonia severity. A decision tree based on CMCT and baseline
severity provided a range of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the threshold
chosen for baseline dystonia severity. In situations where CMCT was not available,
a DT using SEP alone provided better than the majority class classifier accuracy.Conclusion: The results suggest that neurophysiological parameters can help predict
DBS outcomes, and DTs provide a data-driven, highly interpretable decision support
tool that lends itself to being used in clinical practice to help predict potential benefit of
DBS in dystonic children. Our results encourage the introduction of neurophysiological
parameters in assessment pathways, and data collection to facilitate multi-center
evaluation and validation of these potential predictive markers and of the illustrative
decision support tools presented here.",NC,

potential of using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in conjunction with machine learning algorithms in order to automate
the classification of healthy children and TS children. Here we apply Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) method to 44
TS children and 48 age and gender matched healthy children in order to extract the diffusion values from each voxel in
the white matter (WM) skeleton, and a feature selection algorithm (ReliefF) was used to select the most salient voxels
for subsequent classification with support vector machine (SVM). We use a nested cross validation to yield an unbiased
assessment of the classification method and prevent overestimation. The accuracy (88.04%), sensitivity (88.64%) and
specificity (87.50%) were achieved in our method as peak performance of the SVM classifier was achieved using the
axial diffusion (AD) metric, demonstrating the potential of a joint TBSS and SVM pipeline for fast, objective
classification of healthy and TS children. These results support that our methods may be useful for the early
identification of subjects with TS, and hold promise for predicting prognosis and treatment outcome for individuals with

More recently, “wearable”, sensor-based, quantitative, objective, and easy-to-use systems for quantifying PD signs for large numbers of participants over extended durations have been developed. This technology has the potential to significantly improve both clinical diagnosis and management in PD and the conduct of clinical studies. However, the large-scale, high-dimensional character of the data captured by these wearable sensors requires sophisticated signal processing and machine learning algorithms to transform it into scientifically and clinically meaningful information. Such algorithms that “learn” from data have shown remarkable success at making accurate predictions for complex problems where human skill has been required to-date, but they are challenging to evaluate and apply without a basic understanding of the underlying logic upon which they are based.

A novel detection and severity classification algorithm using deep learning approaches was developed in this research to classify the PD severity level based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) signals. Different variations in force patterns generated by the irregularity in vGRF signals due to the gait abnormalities of PD patients can indicate their severity. The main purpose of this research is to aid physicians in detecting early stages of PD, planning efficient treatment, and monitoring disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises preprocessing, feature transfor-mation, and classification processes. In preprocessing, the vGRF signal is divided into 10, 15, and 30 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time domain vGRF signal in windows with varying time lengths is modified into a time–frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature enhancement. Finally, different types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed as deep learning classifiers for classification. The algorithm performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation (kfoldCV). The best average accuracy of the proposed detection algorithm in clas-sifying the PD severity stage classification was 96.52% using ResNet-50 with vGRF data from the PhysioNet database.

In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes).

Methods: We used 1600 randomly selected /aa/ phonation samples from the entire data set to derive rules for filtering out faulty
samples from the data set. The application of these rules, along with a joint age-gender balancing filter, results in a data set of

also inefficient. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning based gait classification system which can
assist the clinician to diagnose the stages of PD is presented. Gait pattern, which plays a significant
role in assessing the human mobility, is a significant biomarker to classify whether the subject is

extract the minimal feature vector using the statistical analysis. Subsequently, the normal distribution
of the data is validated using the Shapiro–Wilk test, and from the spatial and temporal features of gait
pattern, the salient biomarkers are identified using the correlation based feature selection technique.

by the production of Lewy bodies in the brain, resulting in the degeneration of dopaminer-
gic nigrostriatal neurons. A common and debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait
(FoG), which is described as a sudden, episodic inability to make forward progress while
walking despite the intention to do so. FoG can lead to falls and difficulties in everyday
tasks, especially mobility. Conventional PD treatments have a variable impact on miti-
gating FoG due to large heterogeneity within the freezing population, necessitating active
monitoring of an individual’s FoG severity. This study aims to aid the development of ac-
tive FoG severity monitoring using wearable sensors and machine learning. Specifically, it
explores the ternary (3-class) domain of FOG classification (akinetic, kinetic, and no FoG),
which has not been extensively studied before. Specific objectives of this thesis comprises
of: identifying suitable datasets, selecting and optimizing machine learning models, evalu-
ating model performance on participants, and identifying potential applications based on
observed results.
Two datasets were considered for this study, including the Sydney dataset collected by Goh
et al. at the University of Sydney in Australia, and the publicly-available MJFF dataset
comprising multiple collections of data from various groups. The Sydney dataset consists
of 10 participants completing the Ziegler protocol in their “ON” and “OFF” medication
states while equipped with a tri-axial inertial measurement unit (IMU) on their sternum,
lumbar, and bilateral feet. Throughout this dataset, there was a total of 24.9% of the time
spent in an akinetic freeze and 8.87% of the time spent in a kinetic freeze. As for the
MJFF dataset, it was comprised of 100 participants completing a similar Ziegler protocol
and an alternative DeFOG protocol in the two medication states with a lumbar tri-axial
accelerometer. In total, there were 833 trials for the Zeigler protocol in this dataset, and
91 trials for the DeFOG protocol, combining to produce a total of 1.47% of the time spent
in an akinetic freeze and 12.39% of the time spent in a kinetic freeze states.
For classification models, a total of seven architectures were considered, including six clas-
iii
sical models and one deep network model. The classical models received input in the form
of feature vectors, whereas the deep model utilized frequency domain signals along with
a convolutional network backbone to extract information. The features included in this
study were selected from establishing an initial pool, then trimming the included features
down using common feature engineering techniques such as Kendalls correlation, and Min-
imum Redundancy - Maximum Relevance (mRMR). Additionally, all models went through
a randomized grid search for the optimal hyperparameters and architecture parameters to
optimize performance on the utilized datasets.
Testing the models with the participant data in the Sydney dataset revealed that all
classical models and the deep network model encountered challenges in ternary FoG clas-
sification compared to results in the current literature. While some models performed
well for a subset of participants, mainly severe freezers, the majority of the classifiers
struggled to accurately label ternary FoG bouts with many F1-scores falling below 40%.
The top-performing classical model, logistic regression (LogR), faced difficulties in classify-
ing kinetic freezing and temporal accuracy. It was theorized these difficulties arose due to
limited frequency domain features in the final feature set, and limited information about
neighbouring windows when making inferences. While the deep model also struggled with
correctly classifying the timing of the bout, to a larger extent, it had trouble differentiating
between akinetic and kinetic freezing. This drop in performance is likely attributable to
freeze states not achieving steady state, and/or the large heterogeneity within the popu-
lation producing in manifesting akinetic and kinetic freezing (e.g., some akinetic freezes
might have movement, while others are purely akinetic with no movement at all).
When FoG onsets and offsets were not considered, both models demonstrated better per-
formance in classifying severity, with the LogR model predicting correct severity for seven
out of ten individuals and achieving an F1-score of 76% in akinetic freezing and correctly
predicting six out of ten individuals and achieving an F1-score of 60% in kinetic freez-
ing. The deep model correctly classified the combined total severity (akinetic and kinetic
percentages combined) for seven out of ten individuals and achieved an F1-score of 58%.

The findings of this thesis indicate that existing models face challenges in automatically
detecting ternary FoG labels. Further exploration of feature pools and architectures is
warranted to enhance performance in free-living applications. Post-calibration techniques
on model outputs or combining models in a majority voting system are recommended.
Ultimately, this study suggests that the current use of ternary FoG classification may be
better suited for severity estimates or as an annotation tool for clinicians, rather than a
gold standard for free-living labels. More specifically, the models could be used to provide
severity estimates in free-living conditions. These estimates could be later combined with
in-clinic visits to gain a deeper understanding of an individual’s disease progression. Al-
ternatively, actual FoG bout classification can serve as a tool to expedite annotators by
flagging areas of interest prior to a manual confirmation process.",NC,

To identify and/or monitor the progression of such pathologies, several quantitative gait analysis investigations have been performed. Albeit several publications have presented and discussed the results of this strategy in case of such pathologies (considered individually and/or compared to healthy subjects), to the best of the authors' knowledge two or more pathologies have been scarcely investigated simultaneously from the point of view of quantitative gait analysis. To this aim, the main objective of this paper is to presents a new strategy to classify and/or monitor the disease progression of Ataxia and PD using quantitative gait analysis tools and, additionally, machine learning strategies. Specifically, a group of 43 and 22 PD and ataxic patients, respectively, was enrolled and subjected to a quantitative gait analysis investigation – using a microelectromechanical system (the OPAL) - as a result of which ten spatiotemporal quantitative features were automatically extracted. These parameters were fed to five tree-based machine learning algorithms which demonstrated to successfully distinguish Ataxia (following an oversampling step) and PD patients, showing promising metrics, e.g., accuracies and sensitivities up to 81% and 86%. The findings obtained suggest the proposed strategy could drive new research questions in the field and be of direct practical relevance in the clinical setting.

In this pilot study, a set of spatiotemporal gait features, extracted from motion capture data, was used to classify patients as having PD with or without ataxia. The study compares the performance of several tree-based machine learning models, including Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting. The dataset includes gait data from PD patients and individuals with ataxia, totaling 65 participants.

The results showed that tree-based machine learning algorithms, particularly Random Forest, performed well in distinguishing between PD patients with and without ataxia. The classifier achieved high accuracy and provided insights into the most relevant spatiotemporal gait features for FoG detection.",IC,"43 PD, 22 Ataxia"

increases in prevalence as Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses. It is associated
with a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of falls in this population.
Precision-based detection and classi?cation of freezers are critical to developing
tailored treatments rooted in kinematic assessments.
Methods: This study analyzed instrumented stand-and-walk (SAW) trials from
advanced PD patients with STN-DBS. Each patient performed two SAW trials in
their OFF Medication—OFF DBS state. For each trial, gait summary statistics from
wearable sensors were analyzed by machine learning classi?cation algorithms.
These algorithms include k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naïve Bayes,
random forest, and support vector machines (SVM). Each of these models were
selected for their high interpretability. Each algorithm was tasked with classifying
patients whose SAW trials MDS-UPDRS FOG subscore was non-zero as assessed
by a trained movement disorder specialist. These algorithms’ performance was
evaluated using strati?ed ?ve-fold cross-validation.
Results: A total of 21 PD subjects were evaluated (average age 64.24 years,
16 males, mean disease duration of 14 years). Fourteen subjects had freezing
of gait in the OFF MED/OFF DBS. All machine learning models achieved
statistically similar predictive performance (p < 0.05) with high accuracy. Analysis
of random forests’ feature estimation revealed the top-ten spatiotemporal
predictive features utilized in the model: foot strike angle, coronal range of
motion [trunk and lumbar], stride length, gait speed, lateral step variability, and
toe-off angle.
Conclusion: These results indicate that machine learning effectively classi?es
advanced PD patients as freezers or nonfreezers based on SAW trials in
their non-medicated/non-stimulated condition. The machine learning models,

over development. Whether and how brain function in TS also differs across development has been largely understudied.
Here, we used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to examine whole-brain functional
networks in children and adults with TS.
METHODS: Multivariate classification methods were used to find patterns among functional connections that
distinguish individuals with TS from control subjects separately for children and adults (N = 202). We tested whether
the patterns of connections that classify diagnosis in one age group (e.g., children) could classify diagnosis in another
age group (e.g., adults). We also tested whether the developmental trajectory of these connections was altered in TS.
RESULTS: Diagnostic classification was successful in children and adults separately but expressly did not generalize
across age groups, suggesting that the patterns of functional connections that best distinguished individuals with TS
from control subjects were age specific. Developmental patterns among these functional connections used for
diagnostic classification deviated from typical development. Brain networks in childhood TS appeared “older” and
brain networks in adulthood TS appeared “younger” in comparison with typically developing individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that brain networks are differentially altered in children and adults with TS.
The observed developmental trajectory of affected connections is consistent with theories of accelerated and/or
delayed maturation, but may also involve anomalous developmental pathways. These findings further our understanding
of neurodevelopmental trajectories in TS and carry implications for future applications aimed at predicting
the clinical course of TS in individuals over development",NC,

It has also been applied to medical research. Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is characterized by gait abnormalities and is usually evaluated semi-quantitatively by scales. However, more detailed gait characteristics of SCA and related objective methods have not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the gait characteristics of SCA patients, as well as to analyze the correlation between gait parameters, clinical scales, and imaging on deep learning. Methods: Twenty SCA patients diagnosed by genetic detection were included in the study. Ten patients who were tested via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were included in the SCA imaging subgroup. All SCA patients were evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) clinical scales. The gait control group included 16 healthy subjects, and the imaging control group included seven healthy subjects. Gait data consisting of 10 m of free walking of each individual in the SCA group and the gait control group were detected by wearable gait-detection equipment. Stride length, stride time, velocity, supporting-phase percentage, and swinging-phase percentage were extracted as gait parameters. Cerebellar volume and the midsagittal cerebellar proportion in the posterior fossa (MRVD) were calculated according to MR. Results: There were significant differences in stride length, velocity, supporting-phase percentage, and swinging-phase percentage between the SCA group and the gait control group. The stride length and stride velocity of SCA groups were lower while supporting phase was longer than those of the gait control group. SCA group's velocity was negatively correlated with both the ICARS and SARA scores. The cerebellar volume and MRVD of the SCA imaging subgroup were significantly smaller than those of the imaging control group. MRVD was significantly correlated with ICARS and SARA scores, as well as stride velocity variability. Conclusion: SCA gait parameters were characterized by a reduced stride length, slower walking velocity, and longer supporting phase. Additionally, a smaller cerebellar volume correlated with an increased irregularity in gait. Gait characteristics exhibited considerable clinical relevance to hereditary SCA.

Isolated dystonia is a rare neurological disorder where the patient has dystonia without other neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s.

reduced levels of dopamine in the central nervous system. The diagnosis of PD is a difficult and time-consuming
task, and there is no definitive protocol for achieving it. Therefore, several studies have been performed in order
to find reliable PD biomarkers. The analysis of characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of
the techniques that have been used in the search for biomarkers. EEG signals capture the activity of neurons
through electrodes placed on the scalp and with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
their characteristics have started to be used in machine learning (ML) algorithms for the automatic diagnosis
of brain diseases, suggesting that EEG signals are promising biomarkers that could be used for automatic
identification of individuals with PD. Thus, this work evaluates the performance of Hjorth features obtained
from electroencephalographic signals, as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. Using the database available at
the public repository called The Patient Repository for EEG Data + Computational Tools (PRED + CT), we
analyzed EEG data from PD individuals periodically exposed to auditory stimuli. The analysis of the proposed
biomarkers showed differences between healthy and PD patients in parietal, frontal, central, and occipital

The objective of this paper was to develop a method for objective quantification of advanced PD motor symptoms related to off episodes and peak dose dyskinesia, using spiral data gathered by a touch screen telemetry device. More specifically, the aim was to objectively characterize motor symptoms (bradykinesia and dyskinesia), to help in automating the process of visual interpretation of movement anomalies in spirals as rated by movement disorder specialists. Digitized upper limb movement data of 65 advanced PD patients and 10 healthy (HE) subjects were recorded as they performed spiral drawing tasks on a touch screen device in their home environment settings. Several spatiotemporal features were extracted from the time series and used as inputs to machine learning methods. The methods were validated against ratings on animated spirals scored by four movement disorder specialists who visually assessed a set of kinematic features and the motor symptom. The ability of the method to discriminate between PD patients and HE subjects and the test-retest reliability of the computed scores were also evaluated. Computed scores correlated well with mean visual ratings of individual kinematic features. The best performing classifier (Multilayer Perceptron) classified the motor symptom (bradykinesia or dyskinesia) with an accuracy of 84% and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 in relation to visual classifications of the raters.

leads to development of motor complications, most notably levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Persons with PD
and their physicians must regularly modify treatment regimens and timing for optimal relief of symptoms. While
standardized clinical rating scales exist for assessing the severity of PD symptoms, they must be administered by a
trained medical professional and are inherently subjective. Computer vision is an attractive, non-contact, potential
solution for automated assessment of PD, made possible by recent advances in computational power and deep
learning algorithms. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of vision-based assessment of
parkinsonism and LID using pose estimation.
Methods: Nine participants with PD and LID completed a levodopa infusion protocol, where symptoms were
assessed at regular intervals using the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS). Movement trajectories of individual joints were extracted from videos of PD assessment using
Convolutional Pose Machines, a pose estimation algorithm built with deep learning. Features of the movement
trajectories (e.g. kinematic, frequency) were used to train random forests to detect and estimate the severity of
parkinsonism and LID. Communication and drinking tasks were used to assess LID, while leg agility and toe tapping
tasks were used to assess parkinsonism. Feature sets from tasks were also combined to predict total UDysRS and
UPDRS Part III scores.
Results: For LID, the communication task yielded the best results (detection: AUC = 0.930, severity estimation:
r = 0.661). For parkinsonism, leg agility had better results for severity estimation (r = 0.618), while toe tapping
was better for detection (AUC = 0.773). UDysRS and UPDRS Part III scores were predicted with r =0.741 and
0.530, respectively.
Conclusion: The proposed system provides insight into the potential of computer vision and deep learning
for clinical application in PD and demonstrates promising performance for the future translation of deep
learning to PD clinical practices. Convenient and objective assessment of PD symptoms will facilitate more
frequent touchpoints between patients and clinicians, leading to better tailoring of treatment and quality of care.",NC,

spread of adult-­onset isolated dystonia, but a predictive model is still lacking. The aims
of this study were: (i) to develop and validate a predictive model of anatomic spread of
adult-­onset isolated dystonia; and (ii) to evaluate whether presence of tremor associated
with dystonia influences model predictions of spread.
Methods: Adult-­onset isolated dystonia participants with focal onset from the Dystonia
Coalition Natural History Project database were included. We developed two predic-
tion models, one with dystonia as sole disease manifestation (“dystonia-­only”) and one
accepting dystonia OR tremor in any body part as disease manifestations (“dystonia OR
tremor”). Demographic and clinical predictors were selected based on previous evidence,
clinical plausibility of association with spread, or both. We used logistic regressions and
evaluated model discrimination and calibration. Internal validation was carried out based
on bootstrapping.
Results: Both predictive models showed an area under the curve of 0.65 (95% confidence
intervals 0.62–­0.70 and 0.62–­0.69, respectively) and good calibration after internal vali-
dation. In both models, onset of dystonia in body regions other than the neck, older age,
depression and history of neck trauma were predictors of spread.
Conclusions: This predictive modeling of spread in adult-­onset isolated dystonia based
on accessible predictors (demographic and clinical) can be easily implemented to inform
individuals’ risk of spread. Because tremor did not influence prediction of spread, our
results support the argument that tremor is a part of the dystonia syndrome, and not an

tics are typically quantified using “paper and

that adversely impact validity. Video-based methods
to more objectively quantify tics have been developed

and procedures that are resource intensive. Computer
vision approaches that automate detection of atypical

quantification.
Objective: The current proof-of-concept study applied a
computer vision approach to train a supervised deep
learning algorithm to detect eye tics in video, the most
common tic type in patients with TS.
Methods: Videos (N = 54) of 11 adolescent patients with
TS were rigorously coded by trained human raters to
identify 1.5-second clips depicting “eye tic events”
(N = 1775) and “non-tic events” (N = 3680). Clips were
encoded into three-dimensional facial landmarks. Supervised
deep learning was applied to processed data using
random split and disjoint split regimens to simulate
model validity under different conditions.
Results: Area under receiver operating characteristic
curve was 0.89 for the random split regimen, indicating
high accuracy in the algorithm’s ability to properly classify
eye tic vs. non–eye tic movements. Area under receiver
operating characteristic curve was 0.74 for the disjoint
split regimen, suggesting that algorithm generalizability is
more limited when trained on a small patient sample.
Conclusions: The algorithm was successful in
detecting eye tics in unseen validation sets. Automated
tic detection from video is a promising approach for tic
quantification that may have future utility in TS screening,
diagnostics, and treatment outcome measurement.

The resulting models were validated in an independent, clinically well-characterized cohort from the Parkinson's Disease Biomarker Program (n = 263 cases). Our analysis distinguished three distinct disease subtypes with highly predictable progression rates, corresponding to slow, moderate, and fast disease progression. We achieved highly accurate projections of disease progression 5 years after initial diagnosis with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.95 ± 0.01) for the slower progressing group (PDvec1), 0.87 ± 0.03 for moderate progressors, and 0.95 ± 0.02 for the fast-progressing group (PDvec3). We identified serum neurofilament light as a significant indicator of fast disease progression among other key biomarkers of interest.

disease (PD) based on multilevel indices of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).
Methods: Ninety-six PD patients, which included thirty-nine postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype
and fifty-seven tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, were enrolled and allocated to training and validation datasets
with a ratio of 7:3. A total of five types of index, consisting of mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean
amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), degree of centrality (DC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity
(VMHC), and functional connectivity (FC), were extracted. The features were then selected using a twosample
t-test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficient. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) models based on the separate index and multilevel indices
were built, and the performance of models was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC). Feature importance was evaluated using Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values.
Results: The optimal SVM model was obtained based on multilevel rs-fMRI indices, with an AUC of 0.934 in the
training dataset and an AUC of 0.917 in the validation dataset. The AUCs of the models based on the separate
index were ranged from 0.783 to 0.858 for the training dataset and from 0.713 to 0.792 for the validation
dataset. SHAP analysis revealed that functional activity and connectivity in frontal lobe and cerebellum were
important features for differentiating PD subtypes.
Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated multilevel rs-fMRI indices could provide more comprehensive information
on brain functionalteration. Furthermore, the machine learning method based on multilevel rs-fMRI indices
might be served as an alternative approach for automatically classifying clinical subtypes in PD at the individual

Aim:This paper presents a human behavior prediction of dystonia patients

We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to distinguish ataxic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria from normal speech and differentiate ataxic and hypokinetic speech in parkinsonian diseases and cerebellar ataxia. We screened 804 perceptual speech analyses performed in the Samsung Medical Center Neurology Department between January 2017 and December 2020. The data of patients diagnosed with parkinsonian disorders or cerebellar ataxia were included. Two speech tasks (numbering from 1 to 50 and reading nine sentences) were analyzed. We adopted convolutional neural networks and developed a patch-wise wave splitting and integrating AI system for audio classification (PWSI-AI-AC) to differentiate between ataxic and hypokinetic speech. Of the 395 speech recordings for the reading task, 76, 112, and 207 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively.

including levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Despite continuous levodopa treatment, some patients do not
develop LID symptoms, even in later stages of the disease.
Objective: This study explores machine learning (ML) methods using baseline clinical characteristics to predict the
development of LID in PD patients over four years, across multiple cohorts.
Methods: Using interpretable ML approaches, we analyzed clinical data from three independent longitudinal PD
cohorts (LuxPARK, n = 356; PPMI, n = 484; ICEBERG, n = 113) to develop cross-cohort prognostic models and
identify potential predictors for the development of LID. We examined cohort-specific and shared predictive
factors, assessing model performance and stability through cross-validation analyses.
Results: Consistent cross-validation results for single and multiple cohort analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
the ML models and identified baseline clinical characteristics with significant predictive value for the LID
prognosis in PD. Predictors positively correlated with LID include axial symptoms, freezing of gait, and rigidity in
the lower extremities. Conversely, the risk of developing LID was inversely associated with the occurrence of
resting tremors, higher body weight, later onset of PD, and visuospatial abilities.
Conclusions: This study presents interpretable ML models for dyskinesia prognosis with significant predictive
power in cross-cohort analyses. The models may pave the way for proactive interventions against dyskinesia in
PD by optimizing levodopa dosing regimens and adjunct treatments with dopamine agonists or MAO-B in-
hibitors, and by employing non-pharmacological interventions such as dietary adjustments affecting levodopa

means to track response to treatment, including side effects such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Visionbased
systems are advantageous as they do not require physical contact with the body and have minimal instrumentation
compared to wearables. We have developed a vision-based system to quantify a change in dyskinesia
as reported by patients using 2D videos of clinical assessments during acute levodopa infusions.
Methods: Nine participants with PD completed a total of 16 levodopa infusions, where they were asked to report
important changes in dyskinesia (i.e. onset and remission). Participants were simultaneously rated using the
UDysRS Part III (from video recordings analyzed post-hoc). Body joint positions and movements were tracked
using a state-of-the-art deep learning pose estimation algorithm applied to the videos. 416 features (e.g. kinematics,
frequency distribution) were extracted to characterize movements. The sensitivity and specificity of each
feature to patient-reported changes in dyskinesia severity was computed and compared with physician-rated
results.
Results: Features achieved similar or superior performance to the UDysRS for detecting the onset and remission
of dyskinesia. The best AUC for detecting onset of dyskinesia was 0.822 and for remission of dyskinesia was
0.958, compared to 0.826 and 0.802 for the UDysRS.
Conclusions: Video-based features may provide an objective means of quantifying the severity of levodopa-induced

encouraging evidence for future integration of video-based technology into clinical research and

from motion sensor data and extremity, global, or combined (average of extremity and global) mAIMS scores.
Results: Dyskinesia occurring during a levodopa dose cyclewas successfully measured using a wrist-worn sensor. The logarithm
of the power spectrum area between 0.3–3 Hz and the combined clinician scores resulted in the best model performance, with a
correlation coefficient between clinician and model scores of 0.81 and root mean square error of 0.55, both averaged across the

and pattern analysis of neck muscle boundaries to inform
and monitor treatment of cervical dystonia. Methods:
We recorded transverse cervical ultrasound (US) images
and whole-body motion analysis of sixty-one standing
participants (35 cervical dystonia, 26 age matched
controls). We manually annotated 3,272 US images
sampling posture and the functional range of pitch,
yaw, and roll head movements. Using previously validated
methods, we used 60-fold cross validation to train, validate
and test a deep neural network (U-net) to classify pixels to
13 categories (?ve paired neck muscles, skin, ligamentum
nuchae, vertebra). For all participants for their normal
standing posture, we segmented US images and classi?ed
condition (Dystonia/Control), sex and age (higher/lower)
from segment boundaries. We performed an explanatory,
visualization analysis of dystonia muscle-boundaries.
Results: For all segments, agreement with manual labels
was Dice Coef?cient (64 ± 21%) and Hausdorff Distance
(5.7 ± 4 mm). For deep muscle layers, boundaries predicted
central injection sites with average precision 94 ± 3%.
Using leave-one-out cross-validation, a support-vector-
machine classi?ed condition, sex, and age from predicted
muscle boundaries at accuracy 70.5%, 67.2%, 52.4% respectively, exceeding classi?cation by manual labels.
From muscle boundaries, Dystonia clustered optimally
into three sub-groups. These sub-groups are visualized
and explained by three eigen-patterns which correlate
signi?cantly with truncal and head posture. Conclusion:
Using US, neck muscle shape alone discriminates dystonia
from healthy controls. Signi?cance: Using deep learning,

and scoring is useful to independently and objectively
assess tic frequency and severity in patients with
Tourette syndrome. In trained raters, interrater reliability
is good. However, video ratings are time-consuming and
cumbersome, particularly in large-scale studies. Therefore,
we developed two machine learning (ML) algorithms
for automatic tic detection.
Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performances
of state-of-the-art ML approaches for automatic
video-based tic detection in patients with Tourette
syndrome.
Methods: We used 64 videos of n = 35 patients with
Tourette syndrome. The data of six subjects (15 videos with
ratings) were used as a validation set for hyperparameter
optimization. For the binary classification task to distinguish
between tic and no-tic segments, we established two different
supervised learning approaches. First, we manually
extracted features based on landmarks, which served as
input for a Random Forest classifier (Random Forest). Second,
a fully automated deep learning approach was used,
where regions of interest in video snippets were input to a
convolutional neural network (deep neural network).
Results: Tic detection F1 scores (and accuracy) were
82.0% (88.4%) in the Random Forest and 79.5% (88.5%)
in the deep neural network approach.
Conclusions: ML algorithms for automatic tic detection
based on video recordings are feasible and reliable and
could thus become a valuable assessment tool, for
example, for objective tic measurements in clinical trials.

leads to development of motor complications, most notably levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). Persons with PD
and their physicians must regularly modify treatment regimens and timing for optimal relief of symptoms. While
standardized clinical rating scales exist for assessing the severity of PD symptoms, they must be administered by a
trained medical professional and are inherently subjective. Computer vision is an attractive, non-contact, potential
solution for automated assessment of PD, made possible by recent advances in computational power and deep
learning algorithms. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the feasibility of vision-based assessment of
parkinsonism and LID using pose estimation.
Methods: Nine participants with PD and LID completed a levodopa infusion protocol, where symptoms were
assessed at regular intervals using the Unified Dyskinesia Rating Scale (UDysRS) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating
Scale (UPDRS). Movement trajectories of individual joints were extracted from videos of PD assessment using
Convolutional Pose Machines, a pose estimation algorithm built with deep learning. Features of the movement
trajectories (e.g. kinematic, frequency) were used to train random forests to detect and estimate the severity of
parkinsonism and LID. Communication and drinking tasks were used to assess LID, while leg agility and toe tapping
tasks were used to assess parkinsonism. Feature sets from tasks were also combined to predict total UDysRS and
UPDRS Part III scores.
Results: For LID, the communication task yielded the best results (detection: AUC = 0.930, severity estimation:
r = 0.661). For parkinsonism, leg agility had better results for severity estimation (r = 0.618), while toe tapping
was better for detection (AUC = 0.773). UDysRS and UPDRS Part III scores were predicted with r = 0.741 and
0.530, respectively.
Conclusion: The proposed system provides insight into the potential of computer vision and deep learning
for clinical application in PD and demonstrates promising performance for the future translation of deep
learning to PD clinical practices. Convenient and objective assessment of PD symptoms will facilitate more
frequent touchpoints between patients and clinicians, leading to better tailoring of treatment and quality of care",NC,

lack objectivity and require much time and effort of clinical experts. Only a snapshot of the severity
of dyskinetic movements (i.e., choreoathetosis and dystonia) is captured, and they are known to

in a clinical environment. The goal of this study was to investigate whether it is feasible to use
home-based measurements to assess and evaluate the severity of dystonia using smartphone-coupled
inertial sensors and machine learning. Video and sensor data during both active and rest situations
from 12 patients were collected outside a clinical setting. Three clinicians analyzed the videos and
clinically scored the dystonia of the extremities on a 0–4 scale, following the definition of amplitude

different machine learning models using cross-validation. The average F1 scores (0.67  0.19 for
lower extremities and 0.68  0.14 for upper extremities) in independent test datasets indicate that it
is possible to detected dystonia automatically using individually trained models. The predictions
could complement standard dyskinetic CP measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world
assessments that could enhance clinical care. A generalized model, trained with data from other
subjects, shows lower F1 scores (0.45 for lower extremities and 0.34 for upper extremities), likely
due to a lack of training data and dissimilarities between subjects. However, the generalized model
is reasonably able to distinguish between high and lower scores. Future research should focus on

In clinical routine and research the severity of the gait disturbances is assessed within a well-established clinical scale and graded into categorial levels. Sensor-free motion registration and subsequent movement analysis allowed to overcome the obvious shortcoming of such coarse grading: Using time series models (tsfresh, ROCKET) we were not only able to successfully reproduce the categorial scaling (Human performance: 44.88% F1-score; our model: 80.28% F1-score). Particularly subtle, early gait disturbances and longitudinal progression below the perception threshold of the human examiner could be captured (Pearson's correlation coefficient human performance-0.060, not significant; our model:-0.626, p < 0.01). Furthermore, SHAP analysis allowed to identify the most important features for each clinical level of gait deterioration. This could further improve the sensitivity to capture longitudinal changes tailored to the pre-existing level of gait disturbances (Pearson's correlation coefficients up to-0.988, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the ML-based analysis could significantly improve the sensitivity in the assessment of gait disturbances in ataxia patients. Thus, it qualifies as a potential digital outcome parameter for early interventions, therapy monitoring, and home recordings.",IC,Preprint. Not peer-reviewed

We develop a pipeline to detect walking, extract gait features using signal analysis methods, and predict patients’ UPDRS-III gait scores with a machine learning model. As gait features from PD patients with gait impairment are correctly and robustly extracted, mP-Gait is able to observe the fine-grained gait impairment severity fluctuation caused by medication response.

held at midline. However, this has not been examined with objective measures in a large,

Methods: For 80 participants with CD and HT, we analyzed videos from examination
segments in which participants were instructed to 1) let their head drift to its most
comfortable position (null point) and then 2) hold their head straight at midline. We
used our previously developed Computational Motor Objective Rater (CMOR) to
quantify changes in severity, amplitude, and frequency between the two postures.
Results: Although up to 9% of participants had exacerbated HT in midline, across the

Conclusion: When instructed to ?rst let their head drift to its null point and then to hold
their head straight at midline, most patient’s changes in HTwere below the thresholds one
would expect from the sensitivity of clinical rating scales. Counter to common clinical
impression, CMOR objectively showed that HT does not consistently increase at midline

postures, particularly affecting the head and neck. However, current clinical assessment methods for
dystonia rely on simpli?ed rating scales which lack the ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal
features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the
underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework
that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the
impact of therapeutic interventions, speci?cally deep brain stimulation. This frameworkovercomes the
limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an ef?cient and accurate method that is rater-
independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. To evaluate the framework, we
leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort
studies across seven academic centres. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical
validation and derived kinematic variables re?ecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia
severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was also applied to a fully
independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients for comparison between dystonia sub-types.
Computer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with
clinically assigned scores. Across comparisons, we identi?ed consistent kinematic features from full
video assessments encoding information critical to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural

Clinician-performed disease rating scales are relatively insensitive for measuring disease change over time, resulting in large and long clinical trials. We tested the hypothesis that sensors worn continuously at home during natural behaviour and a web-based computer mouse task performed at home could produce interpretable, meaningful and reliable motor measures for potential use in clinical trials. Thirty-four individuals with degenerative ataxias (spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and 6 and multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type) and eight age-matched controls completed the cross-sectional study. Participants wore an ankle and wrist sensor continuously at home for 1 week and completed the Hevelius computer mouse task eight times over 4 weeks. We examined properties of motor primitives called 'submovements' derived from the continuous wearable sensors and properties of computer mouse clicks and trajectories in relationship to patient-reported measures of function (Patient-Reported Outcome Measure of Ataxia) and ataxia rating scales (Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia and the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale). The test-retest reliability of digital measures and differences between ataxia and control participants were evaluated. Individuals with ataxia had smaller, slower and less powerful ankle submovements during natural behaviour at home. A composite measure based on ankle submovements strongly correlated with ataxia rating scale scores (Pearson's r = 0.82-0.88), strongly correlated with self-reported function (r = 0.81), had high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.95) and distinguished ataxia and control participants, including preataxic individuals (n = 4) from controls. A composite measure based on computer mouse movements and clicks strongly correlated with ataxia rating scale total (r = 0.86-0.88) and arm scores (r = 0.65-0.75), correlated well with self-reported function (r = 0.72-0.73) and had high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99). These data indicate that interpretable, meaningful and highly reliable motor measures can be obtained from continuous measurement of natural movement, particularly at the ankle location, and from computer mouse movements during a simple point-and-click task performed at home.

","Freezing of gait (FOG) is a gait impairment,
common in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Predicting
FOG before its onset enables preemptive cueing that can prevent
FOG or reduce its intensity and duration. Deep learning models
have recently been proposed to predict FOG. Such models have
feature learning capabilities and do not require the use of hand-
crafted features. However, some intricacies that are specific to this
approach have not been carefully studied. In particular, the
implication of the lack of accurately labelled pre-FOG data, which
can have a significant impact on model development and
evaluation, has not been fully understood.
In this work, we discuss the challenges in deep learning for
predicting FOG, illustrate the impact of the lack of accurate pre-
FOG data on model development and evaluation, and present a
more reliable evaluation method that is independent of the
labelling of pre-FOG data. Using this new evaluation method, we
study the deep learning schemes for FOG prediction by
performing extensive experiments on a public domain dataset. The
main conclusions of the study include the following: 1) even
without accurate pre-FOG data, deep learning techniques can
achieve very high FOG prediction performance while not
introducing significant false alarms; 2) traditional deep learning
performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
may not be indicative of the FOG prediction performance; 3)
human gait data have high subject-dependent variability, and it
requires different deep learning models to achieve the best
performance for different individuals; and finally 4) transfer
learning is an effective technique for predicting FOG. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to derive these
conclusions via extensive empirical analysis.",NC,

In this study, we propose a new approach that analyzes sub-second movement profiles of the lower-limbs during gait to estimate overall motor severity in cerebellar ataxia. Methods: A total of 37 ataxia subjects and 12 healthy subjects performed a 5 m walk-and-turn task with two ankle-worn inertial sensors. Lower-limb movements were decomposed into one-dimensional sub-movements, namely movement elements. Supervised regression models trained on data features of movement elements estimated the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS) and its sub-scores evaluated by clinicians. The proposed models were also compared to models trained on widely-accepted spatiotemporal gait features. Results: Estimated total BARS showed strong agreement with clinician-evaluated scores with r^2 = 0.72 and a root mean square error of 2.6 BARS points. Movement element-based models significantly outperformed conventional, spatiotemporal gait feature-based models.

Parkinson's disease defined by episodes when patients show a
complete inability to take a step or continue with their
locomotion. In order to develop closed-loop therapeutic
strategies, including deep brain stimulation, a reliable means of
detecting freezing episodes is required. By using wearable
accelerometers, freezing episodes can be detected with energy-
based algorithms when the ratio of the energy in the freeze band
(3 to 8 Hz) to that of the locomotion band (0.5 to 3 Hz) is above
a patient-specific threshold. However, due to the great
variability in patient activity type, walking style, and freezing
pattern, this detection method often does not work. Here we
describe a new FoG-detection method that captures temporal,
spatial, and physiological features and uses a support-vector-
machine to classify freezing episodes. Since our method uses
more diverse features, it is able to more robustly detect FoG
events. We have shown that when the energy-based method fails

intention to walk. Appearing mostly in mid-late stage Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing
manifests as a sudden loss of lower-limb function, and is closely linked to falling, decreased
functional mobility, and loss of independence.
Wearable-sensor based devices can detect freezes aLogReady in progress, and intervene by
delivering auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli called cues. Cueing has been shown to reduce
FOG duration and allow walking to continue. However, FOG detection and cueing systems
require data from the freeze episode itself and are thus unable to prevent freezing. Anticipating
the FOG episode before onset and supplying a timely cue could prevent the freeze from
occurring altogether.
FOG has been predicted in offline analyses by training machine learning models to
identify wearable-sensor signal patterns known to precede FOG. The most commonly used
sensors for FOG detection and prediction are inertial measurement units (IMU) that include an
accelerometer, gyroscope and sometimes magnetometer. Currently, the best FOG prediction
systems use data collected from multiple sensors on various body locations to develop person-
specific models. Multi-sensor systems are more complex and may be challenging to integrate
into real-life assistive devices. The ultimate goal of FOG prediction systems is a user-friendly
assistive device that can be used by anyone experiencing FOG. To achieve this goal, person-
independent models with high FOG prediction performance and a minimal number of
conveniently located sensors are needed.
The objectives of this thesis were: to develop and evaluate FOG detection and
prediction models using IMU and plantar pressure data; determine if event-based or period of
gait disruption FOG definitions have better classification performance for FOG detection and
prediction; and evaluate FOG prediction models that use a single unilateral plantar pressure
insole sensor or bilateral sensors.
In this thesis, IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) and plantar pressure insole sensors
were used to collect data from 11 people with FOG while they walked a freeze provoking path.
v
A custom-made synchronization and labeling program was used synchronize the IMU and
plantar pressure data and annotate FOG episodes. Data were divided into overlapping 1 s
windows with 0.2 s shift between consecutive windows. Time domain, Fourier transform
based, and wavelet transform based features were extracted from the data. A total of 861
features were extracted from each of the 71,000 data windows.
To evaluate the effectiveness of FOG detection and prediction models using plantar
pressure and IMU data features, three feature sets were compared: plantar pressure, IMU, and
both plantar pressure and IMU features. Minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR)
and Relief-F feature selection were performed prior to training boosted ensembles of decision
trees.
The binary classification models identified Total-FOG or Non-FOG states, wherein the
Total-FOG class included windows with data from 2 s before the FOG onset until the end of
the FOG episode. The plantar-pressure-only model had the greatest sensitivity, and the IMU-
only model had the greatest specificity. The best overall model used the combination of plantar
pressure and IMU features, achieving 76.4% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity.
Next, the Total-FOG class components were evaluated individually (i.e., Pre-FOG
windows, freeze windows, and transition windows between Pre-FOG and FOG). The best
model, which used plantar pressure and IMU features, detected windows that contained both
Pre-FOG and FOG data with 85.2% sensitivity, which is equivalent to detecting FOG less than
1 s after the freeze began. Models using both plantar pressure and IMU features performed
better than models that used either sensor type alone.
Datasets used to train machine learning models often generate ground truth FOG labels
based on visual observation of specific lower limb movements (event-based definition) or an
overall inability to walk effectively (period of gait disruption based definition). FOG definition
ambiguity may affect FOG detection and prediction model performance, especially with
respect to multiple FOG in rapid succession. This research examined the effects of defining
FOG either as a period of gait disruption (merging successive FOG), or based on an event (no
merging), on FOG detection and prediction. Plantar pressure and lower limb acceleration data
were used to extract a set of features and train decision tree ensembles. FOG was labeled using
vi
an event-based definition. Additional datasets were then produced by merging FOG that
occurred in rapid succession. A merging threshold was introduced where FOG that were
separated by less than the merging threshold were merged into one episode. FOG detection
and prediction models were trained for merging thresholds of 0, 1, 2, and 3 s. Merging had
little effect on FOG detection model performance; however, for the prediction model, merging
resulted in slightly later FOG identification and lower precision. FOG prediction models may
benefit from using event-based FOG definitions and avoiding merging multiple FOG in rapid
succession.
Despite the known asymmetry of PD motor symptom manifestation, the difference
between the more severely affected side (MSS) and less severely affected side (LSS) is rarely
considered in FOG detection and prediction studies. The additional information provided by
the MSS or LSS, if any, may be beneficial to FOG prediction models, especially if using a
single sensor. To examine the effect of using data from the MSS, LSS, or both limbs, multiple
FOG prediction models were trained and compared. Three datasets were created using plantar
pressure data from the MSS, LSS, and both sides together. Feature selection was performed,
and FOG prediction models were trained using the top 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 features for each
dataset. The best models were the MSS model with 15 features, and the LSS and bilateral
features with 5 features. The LSS model reached the highest sensitivity (79.5%) and identified
the highest percentage of FOG episodes (94.9%). The MSS model achieved the highest
specificity (84.9%) and the lowest false positive (FP) rate (2 FP/walking trial). Overall, the
bilateral model was best. The bilateral model had 77.3% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, and
identified 94.3% of FOG episodes an average of 1.1 s before FOG onset. Compared to the
bilateral model, the LSS model had a higher false positive rate; however, the bilateral and LSS
models were similar in all other evaluation metrics. Therefore, using the LSS model instead of
the bilateral model would produce similar FOG prediction performance at the cost of slightly
more false positives. Given the advantages of single sensor systems, the increased FP rate may
be acceptable. Therefore, a single plantar pressure sensor placed on the LSS could be used to
develop a FOG prediction system and produce performance similar to a bilateral system.",NC,

Adjustments in medication to reduce LID often sacrifice

significant challenge for management of advanced PD. Fifteen
PD subjects with known LID were recruited and instructed to
perform two stationary motor tasks while wearing a compact
wireless motion sensor unit positioned on each hand over the
course of a levodopa dose cycle. Videos of subjects performing
the motor tasks were later scored by expert clinicians to assess
global dyskinesia using the modified Abnormal Involuntary

the impaired gait patternsprecedingFoGto build amachinelearning-
based model for FoG prediction. Acceleration signals
were collected using an accelerometer attached to
the lower back of 12 PD patients with FoG while they
were performing designed FoG-provoking walking tasks.
Step-based impaired gait features and conventional FoG
detection featureswere extracted fromthe signals,basedon
which twoFoGpredictionmodelswere built usingAdaBoost
to validate if the use of the impaired gait features can better
predict FoG. For the correct labeling of the gait prior to
FoG (pre-FoG), the personalized pre-FoG phasewas defined
according to the slope of the impaired gait pattern. The
impaired gait features were relabeled based on the pre-
FoG phase upon which the personalized labeled FoG prediction
model was built. This was compared with the model
built using unified labeling. Results showed that impaired
gait features could better predict FoG than conventional
FoG detection features with low time latency, and personalized
labeling could further improve the FoG prediction
accuracy. Using impaired gait features and personalized
labeling, we built a FoG prediction model with 0.93 sec
of latency. Compared to using conventional features and unified labeling, our model achieved 5.7% higher accuracy
(82.7%) in patient-dependent test and 9.8% higher accuracy
(77.9%) in patient-independent test. Therefore, using the
impaired gait patterns is a promising approachto accurately
predict FoG with low latency.",NC,

Parkinson's disease (PD), but its prolonged usage leads to
additional motor complications, namely levodopa-induced
dyskinesia (LID). To assess LID and adjust drug regimens for
optimal relief, patients attend regular clinic visits. However, the
intermittent nature of these visits can fail to capture important
changes in a person’s condition. With the recent emergence of
deep learning achieving impressive results in a wide array of
fields including computer vision, there is an opportunity for
video analysis to be used for automated assessment of LID.
Deep learning for pose estimation was studied as a viable
means of extracting body movements from PD assessment
videos. Movement features were computed from joint
trajectories. Results show that features derived from vision-
based analysis have moderate to good correlation with clinician
ratings of dyskinesia severity. This study presents the first
application of deep learning to video analysis in PD, and
demonstrates promise for future development of a non-contact

Zhang et al.,2022,Hold that pose: capturing cervical dystonia’s head deviation severity from video,United States,Cervical Dystonia,,Video,CMOR,Head Movement,NA,Spearman Correlation,185 Patient,Own Recruitment,Develop and validate CMOR using video recordings and head posture to measure cervical dystonia,"Objective: Deviated head posture is a defining characteristic of cervical dystonia
(CD). Head posture severity is typically quantified with clinical rating scales
such as the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS).
Because clinical rating scales are inherently subjective, they are susceptible to
variability that reduces their sensitivity as outcome measures. The variability
could be circumvented with methods to measure CD head posture objectively.
However, previously used objective methods require specialized equipment and
have been limited to studies with a small number of cases. The objective of this
study was to evaluate a novel software system—the Computational Motor
Objective Rater (CMOR)—to quantify multi-axis directionality and severity of
head posture in CD using only conventional video camera recordings. Methods:
CMOR is based on computer vision and machine learning technology that captures
3D head angle from video. We used CMOR to quantify the axial patterns
and severity of predominant head posture in a retrospective, cross-sectional
study of 185 patients with isolated CD recruited from 10 sites in the Dystonia
Coalition. Results: The predominant head posture involved more than one axis
in 80.5% of patients and all three axes in 44.4%. CMOR’s metrics for head posture
severity correlated with severity ratings from movement disorders neurologists
using both the TWSTRS-2 and an adapted version of the Global Dystonia
Rating Scale (rho = 0.59–0.68, all p <0.001). Conclusions: CMOR’s convergent
validity with clinical rating scales and reliance upon only conventional video
recordings supports its future potential for large scale multisite clinical trials.",NC,

observation. Technological developments offer alternatives for measuring HT severity that are objective and
amenable to automation.
Objectives: Our objectives were to develop CMOR (Computational Motor Objective Rater; a computer vision-
based software system) to quantify oscillatory and directional aspects of HT from video recordings during a
clinical examination and to test its convergent validity with clinical rating scales.
Methods: For 93 participants with isolated CD and HT enrolled by the Dystonia Coalition, we analyzed video
recordings from an examination segment in which participants were instructed to let their head drift to its most
comfortable dystonic position. We evaluated peak power, frequency, and directional dominance, and used
Spearman’s correlation to measure the agreement between CMOR and clinical ratings.
Results: Power averaged 0.90 (SD 1.80) deg2/Hz, and peak frequency 1.95 (SD 0.94) Hz. The dominant HT axis
was pitch (antero/retrocollis) for 50%, roll (laterocollis) for 6%, and yaw (torticollis) for 44% of participants.
One-sided t-tests showed substantial contributions from the secondary (t = 18.17, p < 0.0001) and tertiary (t =
12.89, p < 0.0001) HT axes. CMOR’s HT severity measure positively correlated with the HT item on the Toronto
Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale-2 (Spearman’s rho = 0.54, p < 0.001).
Conclusions: We demonstrate a new objective method to measure HT severity that requires only conventional
video recordings, quantifies the complexities of HT in CD, and exhibits convergent validity with clinical severity

side effect of the medication, dyskinesias. Close monitoring may bene?t patients by enabling doctors to
tailor a personalised medication regimen. Moreover, dyskinesia monitoring can help neurologists make
more informed decisions in patient’s care.
Objective: To design and validate an algorithm able to be embedded into a system that PD patients could
wear during their activities of daily living with the purpose of registering the occurrence of dyskinesia in
real conditions.
Materials and methods: Data from an accelerometer positioned in the waist are collected at the patient’s
home and are annotated by experienced clinicians. Data collection is divided into two parts: a main
database gathered from 92 patients used to partially train and to evaluate the algorithms based on a
leave-one-out approach and, on the other hand, a second database from 10 patients which have been
used to also train a part of the detection algorithm.
Results: Results show that, depending on the severity and location of dyskinesia, speci?cities and sen-
sitivities higher than 90% are achieved using a leave-one-out methodology. Although mild dyskinesias
presented on the limbs are detected with 95% speci?city and 39% sensitivity, the most important types of
dyskinesia (any strong dyskinesia and trunk mild dyskinesia) are assessed with 95% speci?city and 93%
sensitivity.
Conclusion: The presented algorithmic method and wearable device have been successfully validated in
monitoring the occurrence of strong dyskinesias and mild trunk dyskinesias during activities of daily
living.",NC,

system for the detection of tic events during the Tourette
Syndrome (TS). The system is based on a triaxial accelerometer
placed on the patient’s trunk. TS is a neurological disorder that
emerges during childhood and that is characterized by a large
spectrum of involuntary/compulsive movements and sounds. 12
subjects with chronic TS participated in the study and the tic
events were both measured by the proposed device and visually
classified through video recording. 3D-acceleration timeseries
were combined through a module operator and their noise was
eliminated by a median filter. Signal to noise ratio was
improved by a nonlinear energy operator. Finally, a timevariant
threshold was used to detect tic events. The automatic
tic recognition showed a performance around 80 % in terms of
sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. In conclusion, this simple,
automatic and unobtrusive method offers an alternative
approach to quantitatively assess the tic events in clinical and
non clinical environments. This overcomes the limitations of
the current motor tic evaluation which is done by clinical
observation and/or video-inspection in specialized neurological
centres.",NC,

disease that alters the patients’ motor performance. Patients
suffer many motor symptoms: bradykinesia, dyskinesia and
freezing of gait, among others. Furthermore, patients alternate
between periods in which they are able to move smoothly for
some hours (ON state), and periods with motor complications
(OFF state). An accurate report of PD motor states and
symptoms will enable doctors to personalize medication intake
and, therefore, improve response to treatment. Additionally,
real-time reporting could allow an automatic management of
PD by means of an automatic control of drug-administration
pump doses. Such a system must be able to provide accurate
information without disturbing the patients’ daily life activities.

to last-stage Parkinson's disease (PD), leading to a high risk of falls. The emergence of
the wearable device has offered the possibility of FOG detection and falls of patients
with PD allowing high validation in a low-cost way.
Objective: This systematic review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of
existing literature to establish the forefront of sensors type, placement and algorithm
to detect FOG and falls among patients with PD.
Methods: Two electronic databases were screened by title and abstract to summarize
the state of art on FOG and fall detection with any wearable technology among
patients with PD. To be eligible for inclusion, papers were required to be full-text
articles published in English, and the last search was completed on September 26,
2022. Studies were excluded if they; (i) only examined cueing function for FOG, (ii)
only used non-wearable devices to detect or predict FOG or falls, and (iii) did not
provide sufficient details about the study design and results. A total of 1,748 articles
were retrieved from two databases. However, only 75 articles were deemed to meet
the inclusion criteria according to the title, abstract and full-text reviewed. Variable
was extracted from chosen research, including authorship, details of the experimental
object, type of sensor, device location, activities, year of publication, evaluation in
real-time, the algorithm and detection performance.
Results: A total of 72 on FOG detection and 3 on fall detection were selected for
data extraction. There were wide varieties of the studied population (from 1 to 131),
type of sensor, placement and algorithm. The thigh and ankle were the most popular
device location, and the combination of accelerometer and gyroscope was the most
frequently used inertial measurement unit (IMU). Furthermore, 41.3% of the studies
used the dataset as a resource to examine the validity of their algorithm. The results
also showed that increasingly complex machine-learning algorithms had become
the trend in FOG and fall detection.
Conclusion: These data support the application of the wearable device to access
FOG and falls among patients with PD and controls. Machine learning algorithms
and multiple types of sensors have become the recent trend in this field. Future work
should consider an adequate sample size, and the experiment should be performed
in a free-living environment. Moreover, a consensus on provoking FOG/fall, methods
of assessing validity and algorithm are necessary.",NC,

However, delayed symptom control and a lack of therapeutic biomarkers and a single pallidal sweetspot
region complicates optimal programming. Postoperative management is complex, typically requiring multiple,
lengthy follow-ups with an experienced physician – an important barrier to widespread adoption in medicationrefractory
dystonia patients.
Objective: Here we prospectively tested the best machine-predicted programming settings in a dystonia cohort
treated with GPi-DBS against the settings derived from clinical long-term care in a specialised DBS centre.
Methods: Previously, we reconstructed an anatomical map of motor improvement probability across the pallidal
region using individual stimulation volumes and clinical outcomes in dystonia patients. We used this to develop
an algorithm that tests in silico thousands of putative stimulation settings in de novo patients after reconstructing
an individual, image-based anatomical model of electrode positions, and suggests stimulation parameters with
the highest likelihood of optimal symptom control. To test real-life application, our prospective study compared
results in 10 patients against programming settings derived from long-term care.
Results: In this cohort, dystonia symptom reduction was observed at 74.9 ± 15.3% with C-SURF programming as
compared to 66.3 ± 16.3% with clinical programming (p < 0.012). The average total electrical energy delivered
(TEED) was similar for both the clinical and C-SURF programming (262.0 ?J/s vs. 306.1 ?J/s respectively).
Conclusion: Our findings highlight the clinical potential of machine-based programming in dystonia, which could
markedly reduce the programming burden in postoperative management",NC,
