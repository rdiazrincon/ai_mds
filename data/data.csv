While the primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease overlap with those of other conditions, an accurate diagnosis typically relies on extensive neurological, psychiatric, and physical examinations. Consequently, numerous autonomous diagnostic assistance systems, based on machine learning (ML) methodologies, have emerged to assist in evaluating patients with PD. This work proposes a novel deep learning-based classification of Parkinson's disease (PD) using voice recordings of people into normal, idiopathic Parkinson, and familial Parkinson. The improved jellyfish algorithm (IJFA) is utilized for hyper-parameter selection (HPS) of a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN). The proposed technique makes use of the significant elements of 1D-CNN and filter-based feature selection models. Because of their strong performance in dealing with noisy data, the filter-based algorithms Relief, mRMR, and Fisher Score were chosen as the top choices. Using just 62 characteristics, the combination of deep relief features and deep learning was able to discriminate between people. The competence of the proposed 1D-CNN with IJFA method was determined through specific network metrics. The proposed 1D-CNN with IJFA method attains a total accuracy of 98.6%, which is comparatively better than the existing techniques. The proposed model produced around 9.5% improvements in accuracy, respectively, when compared to the data obtained without dimensionality reduction.",IC,,

During diagnosis, gait abnormalities are among the important symptoms that physicians should consider. However, gait evaluation is challenging and relies on the expertise and subjectivity of clinicians. In this context, the use of an intelligent gait analysis algorithm may assist physicians in order to facilitate the diagnosis process. This paper proposes a novel intelligent Parkinson detection system based on deep learning techniques to analyze gait information. We used 1D convolutional neural network (1D-Convnet) to build a Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier. The proposed model processes 18 1D-signals coming from foot sensors measuring the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF). The first part of the network consists of 18 parallel 1D-Convnet corresponding to system inputs. The second part is a fully connected network that connects the concatenated outputs of the 1D-Convnets to obtain a final classification. We tested our algorithm in Parkinson's detection and in the prediction of the severity of the disease with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Our experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of the proposed method in the detection of Parkinson disease based on gait data. The proposed algorithm achieved an accuracy of 98.7 %. To our knowledge, this is the state-of-the-start performance in Parkinson's gait recognition. Furthermore, we achieved an accuracy of 85.3 % in Parkinson's severity prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm to perform a severity prediction based on the UPDRS. Our results show that the model is able to learn intrinsic characteristics from gait data and to generalize to unseen subjects, which could be helpful in a clinical diagnosis.",IC,,

disease (PD) is urgently required in clinical practice to improve
the diagnostic efficiency and objectivity and to remotely monitor
the motor disorder symptoms and general health of these patients,
especially in view of the travel restrictions due to the recent
coronavirus epidemic. Gait motor disorder is one of the critical
manifestations of PD, and automated assessment of gait is vital
to realize automated assessment of PD patients. To this end,
we propose a novel two-stream spatial-temporal attention graph
convolutional network (2s-ST-AGCN) for video assessment of PD
gait motor disorder. Specifically, the skeleton sequence of human
body is extracted fromvideos to construct spatial-temporal graphs
of joints and bones, and a two-stream spatial-temporal graph
convolutional network is then built to simultaneously model the
static spatial information and dynamic temporal variations. The
multi-scale spatial-temporal attention-aware mechanism is also
designed to effectively extract the discriminative spatial-temporal
features. The deep supervision strategy is then embedded to
minimize classification errors, thereby guiding the weight update
process of the hidden layer to promote significant discriminative
features. Besides, two model-driven terms are integrated into this
deep learning framework to strengthen multi-scale similarity in
the deep supervision and realize sparsification of discriminative
features. Extensive experiments on the clinical video dataset show
that the proposed model exhibits good performance with an
accuracy of 65.66% and an acceptable accuracy of 98.90%, which
is much better than that of the existing sensor- and vision-based

Method:We select some internationally accepted nonlinear features to
extract from EEG signals. By combining Chebyshev type I filter and adaptive
filter, we map EEG signals to the time-frequency domain using time-frequency
analysis and corresponding to the sEMG signal, selecting the
appropriate threshold through the statistical characteristics of the sEMG

Then, the features of the neural information are preprocessed: the noise

develop LID symptoms, even in later stages of the disease.
Objective: This study explores machine learning (ML) methods using baseline clinical characteristics to predict the
development of LID in PD patients over four years, across multiple cohorts.
Methods: Using interpretable ML approaches, we analyzed clinical data from three independent longitudinal PD
cohorts (LuxPARK, n = 356; PPMI, n = 484; ICEBERG, n = 113) to develop cross-cohort prognostic models and
identify potential predictors for the development of LID. We examined cohort-specific and shared predictive
factors, assessing model performance and stability through cross-validation analyses.
Results: Consistent cross-validation results for single and multiple cohort analyses highlighted the effectiveness of
the ML models and identified baseline clinical characteristics with significant predictive value for the LID
prognosis in PD. Predictors positively correlated with LID include axial symptoms, freezing of gait, and rigidity in
the lower extremities. Conversely, the risk of developing LID was inversely associated with the occurrence of
resting tremors, higher body weight, later onset of PD, and visuospatial abilities.
Conclusions: This study presents interpretable ML models for dyskinesia prognosis with significant predictive
power in cross-cohort analyses. The models may pave the way for proactive interventions against dyskinesia in

MDS-UPDRS assessment has been recently required as an

a novel vision-based method for automated assessment of

when the head assumes an unopposed dystonic posture and increases when the head is
held at midline. However, this has not been examined with objective measures in a large,
multicenter cohort.
Methods: For 80 participants with CD and HT, we analyzed videos from examination
segments in which participants were instructed to 1) let their head drift to its most
comfortable position (null point) and then 2) hold their head straight at midline. We
used our previously developed Computational Motor Objective Rater (CMOR) to
quantify changes in severity, amplitude, and frequency between the two postures.
Results: Although up to 9% of participants had exacerbated HT in midline, across the
whole cohort, paired t-tests reveal no signi?cant changes in overall severity (t = ?0.23, p =
0.81), amplitude (t = ?0.80, p = 0.43), and frequency (t = 1.48, p = 0.14) between the two
postures.
Conclusion: When instructed to ?rst let their head drift to its null point and then to hold
their head straight at midline, most patient�s changes in HTwere below the thresholds one
would expect from the sensitivity of clinical rating scales. Counter to common clinical
impression, CMOR objectively showed that HT does not consistently increase at midline

Objectives: Our objectives were to develop CMOR (Computational Motor Objective Rater; a computer vision-

Methods: For 93 participants with isolated CD and HT enrolled by the Dystonia Coalition, we analyzed video
recordings from an examination segment in which participants were instructed to let their head drift to its most

Spearman�s correlation to measure the agreement between CMOR and clinical ratings.
Results: Power averaged 0.90 (SD 1.80) deg2/Hz, and peak frequency 1.95 (SD 0.94) Hz. The dominant HT axis

Objective Rater (CMOR)�to quantify multi-axis directionality and severity of
head posture in CD using only conventional video camera recordings. Methods:
CMOR is based on computer vision and machine learning technology that captures
3D head angle from video. We used CMOR to quantify the axial patterns
and severity of predominant head posture in a retrospective, cross-sectional
study of 185 patients with isolated CD recruited from 10 sites in the Dystonia
Coalition. Results: The predominant head posture involved more than one axis
in 80.5% of patients and all three axes in 44.4%. CMOR�s metrics for head posture
severity correlated with severity ratings from movement disorders neurologists
using both the TWSTRS-2 and an adapted version of the Global Dystonia
Rating Scale (rho = 0.59�0.68, all p <0.001). Conclusions: CMOR�s convergent
validity with clinical rating scales and reliance upon only conventional video
recordings supports its future potential for large scale multisite clinical trials.",NC,,

These techniques are not very reliable, particularly in the early stages of the dis-ease. A novel detection and severity classification algorithm using deep learning approaches was developed in this research to classify the PD severity level based on vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) signals. Different variations in force patterns generated by the irregularity in vGRF signals due to the gait abnormalities of PD patients can indicate their severity. The main purpose of this research is to aid physicians in detecting early stages of PD, planning efficient treatment, and monitoring disease progression. The detection algorithm comprises preprocessing, feature transfor-mation, and classification processes. In preprocessing, the vGRF signal is divided into 10, 15, and 30 s successive time windows. In the feature transformation process, the time domain vGRF signal in windows with varying time lengths is modified into a time�frequency spectrogram using a continuous wavelet transform (CWT). Then, principal component analysis (PCA) is used for feature enhancement. Finally, different types of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed as deep learning classifiers for classification. The algorithm performance was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation (kfoldCV). The best average accuracy of the proposed detection algorithm in clas-sifying the PD severity stage classification was 96.52% using ResNet-50 with vGRF data from the PhysioNet database.

cant and challenging task. Based on the representative action of finger tapping, this paper designs an automatic evaluation
method by deep learning technology to provide big data screening and preliminary evaluation for potential patients with PD.
Presently, doctors use the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale
(MDS-UPDRS) to assess the severity of patients. This method is time-consuming and laborious, and there are subjective
differences. The evaluation method based on sensor equipment is also widely used, but it is expensive and needs professional
guidance, which is not suitable for remote evaluation and patient self-examination. Additionally, it is difficult to collect
patient data for medical research, so it is important to find an objective and automatic assessment method for Parkinson's
dyskinesia based on small samples.
Methods In this study, we designed an automatic evaluation method combining manual features and convolutional neural
network (CNN) suitable for small sample classification. Based on the finger tapping video of Parkinson's patients, we used
the pose estimation model to obtain the action skeleton information and calculated the feature data. We then use the 5-folds
cross validation training model to achieve an optimum trade-off between bias and variance, and finally make a multi-class
prediction through fully connected network (FCN).
Results Our proposed method achieves the current optimal accuracy of 79.7% in this research. We have compared with
the latest methods of related research, and our method is superior to them in terms of accuracy, number of parameters and
floating point operations (FLOPs).
Conclusion The proposed method does not require patients to wear sensor devices and has clear advantages in providing
early screening and remote clinical evaluation for patients with PD. Simultaneously, the proposed method using motion

features of dystonic phenomena, hindering clinical management and limiting understanding of the
underlying neurobiology. To address this, we developed a visual perceptive deep learning framework
that utilizes standard clinical videos to comprehensively evaluate and quantify disease states and the
impact of therapeutic interventions, speci?cally deep brain stimulation. This frameworkovercomes the
limitations of traditional rating scales and offers an ef?cient and accurate method that is rater-
independent for evaluating and monitoring dystonia patients. To evaluate the framework, we
leveraged semi-standardized clinical video data collected in three retrospective, longitudinal cohort
studies across seven academic centres. We extracted static head angle excursions for clinical
validation and derived kinematic variables re?ecting naturalistic head dynamics to predict dystonia
severity, subtype, and neuromodulation effects. The framework was also applied to a fully
independent cohort of generalised dystonia patients for comparison between dystonia sub-types.
Computer vision-derived measurements of head angle excursions showed a strong correlation with
clinically assigned scores. Across comparisons, we identi?ed consistent kinematic features from full
video assessments encoding information critical to disease severity, subtype, and effects of neural

It has also been applied to medical research. Hereditary spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is characterized by gait abnormalities and is usually evaluated semi-quantitatively by scales. However, more detailed gait characteristics of SCA and related objective methods have not yet been established. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the gait characteristics of SCA patients, as well as to analyze the correlation between gait parameters, clinical scales, and imaging on deep learning. Methods: Twenty SCA patients diagnosed by genetic detection were included in the study. Ten patients who were tested via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were included in the SCA imaging subgroup. All SCA patients were evaluated with the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS) and Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) clinical scales. The gait control group included 16 healthy subjects, and the imaging control group included seven healthy subjects. Gait data consisting of 10 m of free walking of each individual in the SCA group and the gait control group were detected by wearable gait-detection equipment. Stride length, stride time, velocity, supporting-phase percentage, and swinging-phase percentage were extracted as gait parameters. Cerebellar volume and the midsagittal cerebellar proportion in the posterior fossa (MRVD) were calculated according to MR. Results: There were significant differences in stride length, velocity, supporting-phase percentage, and swinging-phase percentage between the SCA group and the gait control group. The stride length and stride velocity of SCA groups were lower while supporting phase was longer than those of the gait control group. SCA group's velocity was negatively correlated with both the ICARS and SARA scores. The cerebellar volume and MRVD of the SCA imaging subgroup were significantly smaller than those of the imaging control group. MRVD was significantly correlated with ICARS and SARA scores, as well as stride velocity variability. Conclusion: SCA gait parameters were characterized by a reduced stride length, slower walking velocity, and longer supporting phase. Additionally, a smaller cerebellar volume correlated with an increased irregularity in gait. Gait characteristics exhibited considerable clinical relevance to hereditary SCA. We conclude that a combination of gait parameters, ataxia scales, and MRVD may represent more objective markers for clinical evaluations of SCA.",IC,"This paper doesn't use DL.

different ML models is exploited to detect bradykinesia in the upper extremities and evaluate its
severity. Six PD subjects and seven age-matched healthy controls were equipped with a consumer
smartwatch and asked to perform a set of motor exercises for at least 6 weeks. Different feature sets,
data representations, data augmentation methods, and ML models were implemented and combined.
Data recorded from smartwatches� motion sensors, properly augmented and fed to a combination
of Convolutional Neural Network and Random Forest model, provided the best results, with an
accuracy of 0.86 and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.94. Results suggest that the combination of

Hypokinetic and ataxic dysarthria are common in movement disorders and represent the underlying neuropathology. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model to distinguish ataxic dysarthria and hypokinetic dysarthria from normal speech and differentiate ataxic and hypokinetic speech in parkinsonian diseases and cerebellar ataxia. We screened 804 perceptual speech analyses performed in the Samsung Medical Center Neurology Department between January 2017 and December 2020. The data of patients diagnosed with parkinsonian disorders or cerebellar ataxia were included. Two speech tasks (numbering from 1 to 50 and reading nine sentences) were analyzed. We adopted convolutional neural networks and developed a patch-wise wave splitting and integrating AI system for audio classification (PWSI-AI-AC) to differentiate between ataxic and hypokinetic speech. Of the 395 speech recordings for the reading task, 76, 112, and 207 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. Of the 409 recordings of the numbering task, 82, 111, and 216 were from normal, ataxic dysarthria, and hypokinetic dysarthria subjects, respectively. The reading and numbering task recordings were classified with 5-fold cross-validation using PWSI-AI-AC as follows: hypokinetic dysarthria vs. others (area under the curve: 0.92 � 0.01 and 0.92 � 0.02), ataxia vs. others (0.93 � 0.04 and 0.89 � 0.02), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. ataxia (0.96 � 0.02 and 0.95 � 0.01), hypokinetic dysarthria vs. none (0.86 � 0.03 and 0.87 � 0.05), and ataxia vs. none (0.87 � 0.07 and 0.87 � 0.09), respectively. PWSI-AI-AC showed reliable performance in differentiating ataxic and hypokinetic dysarthria and effectively augmented data to classify the types even with limited training samples.

study was aimed to identify the clinical measurements closely linked with FOG in Chinese
patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and construct prediction models based on those
clinical measurements using Cox regression and machine learning.
Methods: The study enrolled 967 PD patients without FOG in the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y)

means to track response to treatment, including side effects such as levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Visionbased
systems are advantageous as they do not require physical contact with the body and have minimal instrumentation
compared to wearables. We have developed a vision-based system to quantify a change in dyskinesia
as reported by patients using 2D videos of clinical assessments during acute levodopa infusions.
Methods: Nine participants with PD completed a total of 16 levodopa infusions, where they were asked to report
important changes in dyskinesia (i.e. onset and remission). Participants were simultaneously rated using the
UDysRS Part III (from video recordings analyzed post-hoc). Body joint positions and movements were tracked
using a state-of-the-art deep learning pose estimation algorithm applied to the videos. 416 features (e.g. kinematics,
frequency distribution) were extracted to characterize movements. The sensitivity and specificity of each
feature to patient-reported changes in dyskinesia severity was computed and compared with physician-rated
results.
Results: Features achieved similar or superior performance to the UDysRS for detecting the onset and remission
of dyskinesia. The best AUC for detecting onset of dyskinesia was 0.822 and for remission of dyskinesia was
0.958, compared to 0.826 and 0.802 for the UDysRS.
Conclusions: Video-based features may provide an objective means of quantifying the severity of levodopa-induced
dyskinesia, and have responsiveness as good or better than the clinically-rated UDysRS. The results demonstrate
encouraging evidence for future integration of video-based technology into clinical research and

However, delayed symptom control and a lack of therapeutic biomarkers and a single pallidal sweetspot
region complicates optimal programming. Postoperative management is complex, typically requiring multiple,
lengthy follow-ups with an experienced physician � an important barrier to widespread adoption in medicationrefractory
dystonia patients.
Objective: Here we prospectively tested the best machine-predicted programming settings in a dystonia cohort
treated with GPi-DBS against the settings derived from clinical long-term care in a specialised DBS centre.
Methods: Previously, we reconstructed an anatomical map of motor improvement probability across the pallidal
region using individual stimulation volumes and clinical outcomes in dystonia patients. We used this to develop
an algorithm that tests in silico thousands of putative stimulation settings in de novo patients after reconstructing
an individual, image-based anatomical model of electrode positions, and suggests stimulation parameters with
the highest likelihood of optimal symptom control. To test real-life application, our prospective study compared
results in 10 patients against programming settings derived from long-term care.
Results: In this cohort, dystonia symptom reduction was observed at 74.9 � 15.3% with C-SURF programming as
compared to 66.3 � 16.3% with clinical programming (p < 0.012). The average total electrical energy delivered

Objective: The current proof-of-concept study applied a
computer vision approach to train a supervised deep

common tic type in patients with TS.
Methods: Videos (N = 54) of 11 adolescent patients with
TS were rigorously coded by trained human raters to
identify 1.5-second clips depicting �eye tic events�
(N = 1775) and �non-tic events� (N = 3680). Clips were
encoded into three-dimensional facial landmarks. Supervised
deep learning was applied to processed data using
random split and disjoint split regimens to simulate
model validity under different conditions.
Results: Area under receiver operating characteristic
curve was 0.89 for the random split regimen, indicating
high accuracy in the algorithm�s ability to properly classify
eye tic vs. non�eye tic movements. Area under receiver
operating characteristic curve was 0.74 for the disjoint

more limited when trained on a small patient sample.
Conclusions: The algorithm was successful in
detecting eye tics in unseen validation sets. Automated
tic detection from video is a promising approach for tic

the difference between the latent spaces corresponding to the two data modalities. This makes our
method capable of dealing with missing modalities during inference. We show that our proposed

and vocal sounds, better known as tics. Cases of mild Tourette can have tics numerous times throughout the day, while severe
cases may have tics every 5 to 10 seconds. At certain times, typically during high levels of stress, tics become chained in an
incessant, continuous fashion�this is known as a tic attack. Tic attacks incapacitate the patient, rendering it difficult for them to
move, perform daily actions, and even communicate with others. Caretakers�usually guardians, family members, or nurses�can
help reduce the time tic attacks last with their presence and by providing emotional support to the patient.
Objective: We describe TSBand, a wearable wristband that uses machine learning algorithms and a variety of sensors to monitor
for tic attacks and notify caretakers when an attack occurs.
Methods: We conducted a research survey with 70 Tourette patients to determine the usability and functionality of TSBand;
internal review board approval was not required.
Results: This study has resulted in a smart wristband prototype that costs US $62.74; it uses movement, heart rate, sweat, and
body temperature to detect tic attacks using a hybrid local outlier factoring and regression algorithm. An audio tic attack detection
mechanism is also included, using recurrent neural networks, and a manually activated backup button and backup audio mechanism
are fitted to alert caretakers on the personalized companion app.
Conclusions: TSBand enables the caretaker to provide support faster and prevent excessive self-harm or injury during the attack.
It is an affordable and effective solution, solving a problem that many Tourette patients, often children, face. This study has not
had the opportunity to test TSBand with any Tourette patients, and we aim to perform rigorous testing and analysis after grant
funding is secured.",NC,,Wrist

in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD), which man-
ifests as sudden dif?culties in starting or continuing locomotion.
FoG often results in falls and negatively affect a patient�s quality

detect FoG events using signals derived from wearable sensors.
However, predicting FoG before it actually occurs opens the
possibility of preemptive cueing, which can potentially avoid (or
reduce the intensity and duration of) the episodes. Moreover,
human gait involves signi?cant subject-based variability and a
machine learning model trained on a particular patient�s data
may not generalize well to other patients. In this paper, we study
the performance of advanced deep learning algorithms to predict
FoG events in short time durations before their occurrence.
We further study the performance of domain adaptation (or
transfer learning) algorithms to address the domain disparity
between data from different subjects, in order to develop a
better prediction model for a particular subject. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the ?rst research effort to study domain
adaptation algorithms to predict FoG episodes in patients with
PD. Our extensive empirical studies on a publicly available

well-established therapy for idiopathic/genetic dystonia, benefits for acquired dystonia
are varied, ranging from modest improvement to deterioration. Predictive biomarkers to
aid DBS prognosis for children are lacking, especially in acquired dystonias, such as
dystonic Cerebral Palsy. We explored the potential role of machine learning techniques
to identify parameters that could help predict DBS outcome.
Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 244 children attending King�s College
Hospital between September 2007 and June 2018 for neurophysiological tests as part
of their assessment for possible DBS at Evelina London Children�s Hospital. For the 133
individuals who underwent DBS and had 1-year outcome data available, we assessed
the potential predictive value of six patient parameters: sex, etiology (including cerebral
palsy), baseline severity (Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale-motor score),
cranial MRI and two neurophysiological tests, Central Motor Conduction Time (CMCT)
and Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SEP). We applied machine learning analysis to
determine the best combination of these features to aid DBS prognosis. We developed
a classification algorithm based on Decision Trees (DTs) with k-fold cross validation for
independent testing. We analyzed all possible combinations of the six features and
focused on acquired dystonias.
Results: Several trees resulted in better accuracy than the majority class classifier.
However, the two features that consistently appeared in top 10 DTs were CMCT
and baseline dystonia severity. A decision tree based on CMCT and baseline
severity provided a range of sensitivity and specificity, depending on the threshold
chosen for baseline dystonia severity. In situations where CMCT was not available,
a DT using SEP alone provided better than the majority class classifier accuracy.Conclusion: The results suggest that neurophysiological parameters can help predict
DBS outcomes, and DTs provide a data-driven, highly interpretable decision support
tool that lends itself to being used in clinical practice to help predict potential benefit of
DBS in dystonic children. Our results encourage the introduction of neurophysiological
parameters in assessment pathways, and data collection to facilitate multi-center
evaluation and validation of these potential predictive markers and of the illustrative
decision support tools presented here.",NC,,

Parkinson�s disease (PD). Wearable FOG identification systems can improve gait and
reduce the risk of falling due to FOG by detecting FOG in real-time and providing a cue to
reduce freeze duration. However, FOG prediction and prevention is desirable. Datasets
used to train machine learning models often generate ground truth FOG labels based on
visual observation of specific lower limb movements (event-based definition) or an overall
inability to walk effectively (period of gait disruption based definition). FOG definition ambiguity
may affect model performance, especially with respect to multiple FOG in rapid succession.
This research examined whether merging multiple freezes that occurred in rapid
succession could improve FOG detection and prediction model performance. Plantar pressure
and lower limb acceleration data were used to extract a feature set and train decision
tree ensembles. FOG was labeled using an event-based definition. Additional datasets
were then produced by merging FOG that occurred in rapid succession. A merging threshold
was introduced where FOG that were separated by less than the merging threshold
were merged into one episode. FOG detection and prediction models were trained for merging
thresholds of 0, 1, 2, and 3 s. Merging slightly improved FOG detection model performance;
however, for the prediction model, merging resulted in slightly later FOG
identification and lower precision. FOG prediction models may benefit from using eventbased
FOG definitions and avoiding merging multiple FOG in rapid succession.",NC,,"Thigh, Shank, Feet"

in mid to late-stage Parkinson�s disease (PD) and can lead to falling and injury. A system that
predicts freezing before it occurs or detects freezing immediately after onset would generate an
opportunity for FOG prevention or mitigation and thus enhance safe mobility and quality of life.
This research used accelerometer, gyroscope, and plantar pressure sensors to extract 861 features
from walking data collected from 11 people with FOG. Minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance
and Relief-F feature selection were performed prior to training boosted ensembles of decision trees.
The binary classification models identified Total-FOG or No FOG states, wherein the Total-FOG class
included data windows from 2 s before the FOG onset until the end of the FOG episode. Three
feature sets were compared: plantar pressure, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and both plantar
pressure and IMU features. The plantar-pressure-only model had the greatest sensitivity and the
IMU-only model had the greatest specificity. The best overall model used the combination of plantar
pressure and IMU features, achieving 76.4% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity. Next, the Total-FOG
class components were evaluated individually (i.e., Pre-FOG windows, Freeze windows, transition
windows between Pre-FOG and Freeze). The best model detected windows that contained both
Pre-FOG and FOG data with 85.2% sensitivity, which is equivalent to detecting FOG less than 1 s
after the freeze began. Windows of FOG data were detected with 93.4% sensitivity. The IMU and
plantar pressure feature-based model slightly outperformed models that used data from a single
sensor type. The model achieved early detection by identifying the transition from Pre-FOG to FOG
while maintaining excellent FOG detection performance (93.4% sensitivity). Therefore, if used as
part of an intelligent, real-time FOG identification and cueing system, even if the Pre-FOG state were
missed, the model would perform well as a freeze detection and cueing system that could improve
the mobility and independence of people with PD during their daily activities.",NC,,"Feet, Shank, Thigh"

and Bilateral Plantar-Pressure Data",Canada,FoG,,Plantar Pressure,DT,Walking,LOOCV,"Sensitivity, Specificity, False Positives",7 FoG,Own Recruitment,Prediction of Freezing of Gait in Parkinson�s Disease using plantar pressure data,"Background: Freezing of gait (FOG) is an intermittent walking disturbance experienced
by people with Parkinson�s disease (PD). FOG has been linked to falling, injury, and
overall reduced mobility. Wearable sensor-based devices can detect freezes already in
progress and provide a cue to help the person resume walking. While this is helpful,
predicting FOG episodes before onset and providing a timely cue may prevent the freeze
from occurring. Wearable sensors mounted on various body parts have been used to
develop FOG prediction systems. Despite the known asymmetry of PD motor symptom
manifestation, the difference between the most affected side (MAS) and least affected
side (LAS) is rarely considered in FOG detection and prediction studies.
Methods: To examine the effect of using data from the MAS, LAS, or both limbs for FOG
prediction, plantar pressure data were collected during a series of walking trials and used
to extract time and frequency-based features. Three datasets were created using plantar
pressure data from the MAS, LAS, and both sides together. ReliefF feature selection was
performed. FOG prediction models were trained using the top 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30
features for each dataset.
Results: The best models were the MAS model with 15 features and the LAS and
bilateral models with 5 features. The LAS model had the highest sensitivity (79.5%) and
identified the highest percentage of FOG episodes (94.9%). The MAS model achieved
the highest specificity (84.9%) and lowest false positive rate (1.9 false positives/walking
trial). Overall, the bilateral model was best with 77.3% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity. In
addition, the bilateral model identified 94.2% of FOG episodes an average of 0.8 s before
FOG onset. Compared to the bilateral model, the LAS model had a higher false positive
rate; however, the bilateral and LASmodels were similar in all the other evaluationmetrics.
Conclusion: The LAS model would have similar FOG prediction performance to the
bilateral model at the cost of slightly more false positives. Given the advantages of single
sensor systems, the increased false positive rate may be acceptable to people with PD.
Therefore, a single plantar pressure sensor placed on the LAS could be used to develop
a FOG prediction system and produce performance similar to a bilateral system.",NC,,Feet

adolescents with dyskinetic cerebral palsy (CP) is now commonly performed by visual evaluation
either directly in the doctor�s office or from video recordings using standardized scales. Both methods
lack objectivity and require much time and effort of clinical experts. Only a snapshot of the severity
of dyskinetic movements (i.e., choreoathetosis and dystonia) is captured, and they are known to
fluctuate over time and can increase with fatigue, pain, stress or emotions, which likely happens
in a clinical environment. The goal of this study was to investigate whether it is feasible to use
home-based measurements to assess and evaluate the severity of dystonia using smartphone-coupled
inertial sensors and machine learning. Video and sensor data during both active and rest situations
from 12 patients were collected outside a clinical setting. Three clinicians analyzed the videos and
clinically scored the dystonia of the extremities on a 0�4 scale, following the definition of amplitude
of the Dyskinesia Impairment Scale. The clinical scores and the sensor data were coupled to train
different machine learning models using cross-validation. The average F1 scores (0.67  0.19 for
lower extremities and 0.68  0.14 for upper extremities) in independent test datasets indicate that it
is possible to detected dystonia automatically using individually trained models. The predictions
could complement standard dyskinetic CP measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world
assessments that could enhance clinical care. A generalized model, trained with data from other
subjects, shows lower F1 scores (0.45 for lower extremities and 0.34 for upper extremities), likely
due to a lack of training data and dissimilarities between subjects. However, the generalized model
is reasonably able to distinguish between high and lower scores. Future research should focus on
gathering more high-quality data and study how the models perform over the whole day",NC,,"Forearm, Lower Leg"

This kind of rating largely depends on the expertise of the doctors, which is not only subjective but
also inefficient. Hence, in this paper, a machine learning based gait classification system which can
assist the clinician to diagnose the stages of PD is presented. Gait pattern, which plays a significant
role in assessing the human mobility, is a significant biomarker to classify whether the subject is
healthy or affected with PD. Hence, we utilize the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) gait dataset and
extract the minimal feature vector using the statistical analysis. Subsequently, the normal distribution
of the data is validated using the Shapiro�Wilk test, and from the spatial and temporal features of gait
pattern, the salient biomarkers are identified using the correlation based feature selection technique.
Four supervised machine learning algorithms namely decision tree (DT), support vector machine

affecting more than 50% of patients in advanced stages of the disease. Wearable technology has been
widely used for its automatic detection, and some papers have been recently published in the direction
of its prediction. Such predictions may be used for the administration of cues, in order to prevent the
occurrence of gait freezing. The aim of the present study was to propose a wearable system able to
catch the typical degradation of the walking pattern preceding FOG episodes, to achieve reliable FOG
prediction using machine learning algorithms and verify whether dopaminergic therapy affects the
ability of our system to detect and predict FOG. Methods: A cohort of 11 Parkinson's disease patients
receiving (on) and not receiving (off) dopaminergic therapy was equipped with two inertial sensors
placed on each shin, and asked to perform a timed up and go test. We performed a step-to-step
segmentation of the angular velocity signals and subsequent feature extraction from both time and
frequency domains. We employed a wrapper approach for feature selection and optimized different
machine learning classi?ers in order to catch FOG and pre-FOG episodes. Results: The implemented
FOG detection algorithm achieved excellent performance in a leave-one-subject-out validation, in
patients both on and off therapy. As for pre-FOG detection, the implemented classi?cation algorithm
achieved 84.1% (85.5%) sensitivity, 85.9% (86.3%) speci?city and 85.5% (86.1%) accuracy in leave-one-
subject-out validation, in patients on (off) therapy. When the classi?cation model was trained with
data from patients on (off) and tested on patients off (on), we found 84.0% (56.6%) sensitivity, 88.3%
(92.5%) speci?city and 87.4% (86.3%) accuracy. Conclusions: Machine learning models are capable
of predicting FOG before its actual occurrence with adequate accuracy. The dopaminergic therapy

Dystonia is a movement disorder classi?ed by involuntary patterned or twisting body movements, which further results in atypical postures (2). Isolated dystonia is a rare neurological disorder where the patient has dystonia without other neurological disorders like Alzheimer�s. Dystonia often harms the quality of life and can be markedly disabling (3); furthermore, a relatively high number of cases are misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed because of the non-availability of a global biomarker.
In a recent research paper by Valeriani and Simonyan (4), a deep learning-based method was proposed, i.e., DystoniaNet, which can recognize a microstructural neural network biomarker for the diagnosis of dystonia from raw MRIs. The biomarker-based on DystoniaNet depicted an overall accuracy of 98.8%, including 3.5% cases in which the network referred the case for further analysis with a diagnosis time of 0.36 s per subject; this was a signi?cant improvement over shallow machine learning networks.

Previous studies have attempted automatic diagnosis of Ataxia with the help of wearable biomarkers, Kinect, and other sensors. These sensors, while accurate, do not scale efficiently well to naturalistic deployment settings. In this study, we propose a method for identifying ataxic symptoms by analyzing videos of participants walking down a hallway, captured with a standard monocular camera. In a collaboration with 11 medical sites located in 8 different states across the United States, we collected a dataset of 155 videos along with their severity rating from 89 participants (24 controls and 65 diagnosed with or are pre-manifest spinocerebellar ataxias). The participants performed the gait task of the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). We develop a computer vision pipeline to detect, track, and separate the participants from their surroundings and construct several features from their body pose coordinates to capture gait characteristics such as step width, step length, swing, stability, speed, etc. Our system is able to identify and track a patient in complex scenarios. For example, if there are multiple people present in the video or an interruption from a passerby. Our Ataxia risk-prediction model achieves 83.06% accuracy and an 80.23% F1 score. Similarly, our Ataxia severity-assessment model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) score of 0.6225 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient score of 0.7268. Our model competitively performed when evaluated on data from medical sites not used during training. Through feature importance analysis, we found that our models associate wider steps, decreased walking speed, and increased instability with greater Ataxia severity, which is consistent with previously established clinical knowledge. Furthermore, we are releasing the models and the body-pose coordinate dataset to the research community - the largest dataset on ataxic gait (to our knowledge). Our models could contribute to improving health access by enabling remote Ataxia assessment in non-clinical settings without requiring any sensors or special cameras.

the main factor limiting the accurate assessment is the difficulty
of mining the fine-grained discriminative motion features.
Therefore, we propose a novel contrastive graph convolutional

enhancing the specificity of the learnt class-specific features.
Subsequently, a multi-stream joint sparse learning mechanism
was designed to eliminate potentially similar redundant features
of joint position and motion, hence strengthening the discriminability
of features extracted from different streams. Finally,
a spatial-temporal interaction graph convolutional module was
developed to explicitly model remote dependencies across time
and space, and hence boost the mining of fine-grained motion
features. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that
this method achieved remarkable classification performance on a

From the original data based on years 0 (baseline) and 1, we created new datasets as inputs to the prediction task: (i,ii) CSD0 and CSD01: cross-sectional datasets from year 0 only and both years 0 & 1, respectively; (iii) TD01: timeless dataset from both years 0 & 1. In addition, PD subtype in year 4 was considered as outcome. Finally, high score features were derived via ensemble voting based on their prioritizations from feature selector algorithms (FSAs). Results: In clustering task, the most optimal combinations (out of 981) were selected by individual FSAs to enable high correlation compared to using all features (arriving at 547). In prediction task, we were able to select optimal combinations, resulting in an accuracy > 90% only for timeless dataset (TD01); there, we were able to select the most optimal combination using 77 features, directly selected by FSAs. In both tasks, however, using combination of only high score features from ensemble voting did not en- able acceptable performances, showing optimal feature selection via individual FSAs to be more effective. Conclusion: Combining non-imaging information with SPECT-based radiomics features, and optimal uti- lization of HMLSs, can enable robust identification of subtypes as well as appropriate prediction of these subtypes in PD patients. Moreover, use of timeless dataset, beyond cross-sectional datasets, enabled pre- dictive accuracies over 90%. Overall, we showed that radiomics features extracted from SPECT images are important in clustering as well as prediction of PD subtypes.",NC,,

One important clinical feature is decrement, whereby the range of finger motion decreases over the course of the observation. This decrement has been assumed to be linear but has not been examined closely. We previously developed a method to extract a time series representation of a finger-tapping clinical test from 137 smartphone video recordings. Here, we show how the signal can be processed to visualize archetypal progression of decrement. We use k-means with features derived from dynamic time warping to compare similarity of time series. To generate the archetypal time series corresponding to each cluster, we apply both a simple arithmetic mean and dynamic time warping barycenter averaging to the time series belonging to each cluster. Visual inspection of the cluster-average time series showed two main trends. These corresponded well with participants with no bradykinesia and participants with severe bradykinesia. The visualizations support the concept that decrement tends to present as a linear decrease in range of motion over time.",IC,,

increases in prevalence as Parkinson's disease (PD) progresses. It is associated
with a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of falls in this population.
Precision-based detection and classi?cation of freezers are critical to developing
tailored treatments rooted in kinematic assessments.
Methods: This study analyzed instrumented stand-and-walk (SAW) trials from
advanced PD patients with STN-DBS. Each patient performed two SAW trials in
their OFF Medication�OFF DBS state. For each trial, gait summary statistics from
wearable sensors were analyzed by machine learning classi?cation algorithms.
These algorithms include k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, na�ve Bayes,
random forest, and support vector machines (SVM). Each of these models were
selected for their high interpretability. Each algorithm was tasked with classifying
patients whose SAW trials MDS-UPDRS FOG subscore was non-zero as assessed
by a trained movement disorder specialist. These algorithms� performance was
evaluated using strati?ed ?ve-fold cross-validation.
Results: A total of 21 PD subjects were evaluated (average age 64.24 years,
16 males, mean disease duration of 14 years). Fourteen subjects had freezing
of gait in the OFF MED/OFF DBS. All machine learning models achieved
statistically similar predictive performance (p < 0.05) with high accuracy. Analysis

Objective: To determine whether a wrist-worn motion sensor unit could be used to ascertain global dyskinesia severity over a
levodopa dose cycle and to develop a severity scoring algorithm highly correlated with clinician ratings.
Methods: Fifteen individuals with PD were instrumented with a wrist-worn motion sensor unit, and data were collected with

of this study were: (i) to develop and validate a predictive model of anatomic spread of
adult-�onset isolated dystonia; and (ii) to evaluate whether presence of tremor associated
with dystonia influences model predictions of spread.
Methods: Adult-�onset isolated dystonia participants with focal onset from the Dystonia
Coalition Natural History Project database were included. We developed two predic-
tion models, one with dystonia as sole disease manifestation (�dystonia-�only�) and one
accepting dystonia OR tremor in any body part as disease manifestations (�dystonia OR
tremor�). Demographic and clinical predictors were selected based on previous evidence,
clinical plausibility of association with spread, or both. We used logistic regressions and
evaluated model discrimination and calibration. Internal validation was carried out based
on bootstrapping.
Results: Both predictive models showed an area under the curve of 0.65 (95% confidence
intervals 0.62��0.70 and 0.62��0.69, respectively) and good calibration after internal vali-
dation. In both models, onset of dystonia in body regions other than the neck, older age,
depression and history of neck trauma were predictors of spread.
Conclusions: This predictive modeling of spread in adult-�onset isolated dystonia based
on accessible predictors (demographic and clinical) can be easily implemented to inform
individuals� risk of spread. Because tremor did not influence prediction of spread, our
results support the argument that tremor is a part of the dystonia syndrome, and not an

Thirty-four individuals with degenerative ataxias (spinocerebellar ataxia types 1, 2, 3 and 6 and multiple system atrophy of the cerebellar type) and eight age-matched controls completed the cross-sectional study. Participants wore an ankle and wrist sensor continuously at home for 1 week and completed the Hevelius computer mouse task eight times over 4 weeks.

The test-retest reliability of digital measures and differences between ataxia and control participants were evaluated. Individuals with ataxia had smaller, slower and less powerful ankle submovements during natural behaviour at home.

been associated with increased fall risk and decreased quality of life. Freezing episodes can be mitigated or prevented
with external intervention such as visual or auditory cues, activated by FOG prediction and detection systems. While
most research on FOG detection and prediction has been based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) and accelerometer
data, plantar-pressure data may capture subtle weight shifts unique to FOG episodes. Different machine learning
algorithms have been used for FOG detection and prediction; however, long short-term memory (LSTM) deep
learning methods hold an advantage when dealing with time-series data, such as sensor data. This research aimed
to determine if LSTM can be used to detect and predict FOG from plantar pressure data alone, specifically for use in a
real-time wearable system.
Methods: Plantar pressure data were collected from pressure-sensing insole sensors worn by 11 participants with PD
as they walked a predefined freeze-provoking path. FOG instances were labelled, 16 features were extracted, and the
dataset was balanced and normalized (z-score). The resulting datasets were classified using long short-term memory
neural-network models. Separate models were trained for detection and prediction. For prediction models, data
before FOG were included in the target class. Leave-one-freezer-out cross validation was used for model evaluation. In
addition, the models were tested on all non-freezer data to determine model specificity.
Results: The best FOG detection model had 82.1% (SD 6.2%) mean sensitivity and 89.5% (SD 3.6%) mean specificity
for one-freezer-held-out cross validation. Specificity improved to 93.3% (SD 4.0%) when ignoring inactive state data
(standing) and analyzing the model only on active states (turning and walking). The model correctly detected 95% of
freeze episodes. The best FOG prediction method achieved 72.5% (SD 13.6%) mean sensitivity and 81.2% (SD 6.8%)
mean specificity for one-freezer-held-out cross validation.
Conclusions: Based on FOG data collected in a laboratory, the results suggest that plantar pressure data can be used
for FOG detection and prediction. However, further research is required to improve FOG prediction performance,
including training with a larger sample of people who experience FOG.",NC,,

","Freezing of gait (FOG) is a gait impairment,
common in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Predicting
FOG before its onset enables preemptive cueing that can prevent
FOG or reduce its intensity and duration. Deep learning models
have recently been proposed to predict FOG. Such models have
feature learning capabilities and do not require the use of hand-
crafted features. However, some intricacies that are specific to this
approach have not been carefully studied. In particular, the
implication of the lack of accurately labelled pre-FOG data, which
can have a significant impact on model development and
evaluation, has not been fully understood.
In this work, we discuss the challenges in deep learning for
predicting FOG, illustrate the impact of the lack of accurate pre-
FOG data on model development and evaluation, and present a
more reliable evaluation method that is independent of the
labelling of pre-FOG data. Using this new evaluation method, we
study the deep learning schemes for FOG prediction by
performing extensive experiments on a public domain dataset. The
main conclusions of the study include the following: 1) even
without accurate pre-FOG data, deep learning techniques can
achieve very high FOG prediction performance while not
introducing significant false alarms; 2) traditional deep learning
performance metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
may not be indicative of the FOG prediction performance; 3)
human gait data have high subject-dependent variability, and it
requires different deep learning models to achieve the best

However, during early-stage PD, these symptoms are subtle and difficult to quantify by experts, which might
result in delayed diagnosis and suboptimal disease management.
Objective: To evaluate the use of videos and machine learning (ML) for automatic quantification of motor
symptoms in early-stage PD.
Methods: We analyzed videos of three movement tasks�Finger Tapping, Hand Movement, and Leg Agility�from
26 aged-matched healthy controls and 31 early-stage PD patients. Utilizing ML algorithms for pose estimation we
extracted kinematic features from these videos and trained three classification models based on left and rightside
movements, and right/left symmetry. The models were trained to differentiate healthy controls from
early-stage PD from videos.
Results: Combining left side, right side, and symmetry features resulted in a PD detection accuracy of 79 % from
Finger Tap videos, 75 % from Hand Movement videos, 79 % from Leg Agility videos, and 86 % when combining
the three tasks using a soft voting approach. In contrast, the classification accuracy varied between 40 % and 72

Conclusions: Our methodology effectively differentiated between early-stage PD and healthy controls using videos

The objective of this paper was to develop a method for objective quantification of advanced PD motor symptoms related to off episodes and peak dose dyskinesia, using spiral data gathered by a touch screen telemetry device. More specifically, the aim was to objectively characterize motor symptoms (bradykinesia and dyskinesia), to help in automating the process of visual interpretation of movement anomalies in spirals as rated by movement disorder specialists. Digitized upper limb movement data of 65 advanced PD patients and 10 healthy (HE) subjects were recorded as they performed spiral drawing tasks on a touch screen device in their home environment settings. Several spatiotemporal features were extracted from the time series and used as inputs to machine learning methods. The methods were validated against ratings on animated spirals scored by four movement disorder specialists who visually assessed a set of kinematic features and the motor symptom. The ability of the method to discriminate between PD patients and HE subjects and the test-retest reliability of the computed scores were also evaluated. Computed scores correlated well with mean visual ratings of individual kinematic features. The best performing classifier (Multilayer Perceptron) classified the motor symptom (bradykinesia or dyskinesia) with an accuracy of 84% and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.86 in relation to visual classifications of the raters.

inflationary effects that occur in medical data sets and allow models to easily reach small training losses and
prevent skillful learning. We investigated two data sets of sustained vowel phonation from participants with

performances on these were artificially enhanced due to the inflationary effects. Our experiments showed that
removing each inflationary effect corresponded with a decrease in classification accuracy, and that removing
all inflationary effects reduced the evaluated performance by up to 30%. Additionally, the performance on a

Gait
analysis is a primary alternative to observe, quantify and follow Parkinson�s disease (PD). Nonetheless, these patterns are
coarsely captured from marker-based setups which alter natural gestures and limit the sensibility to describe disease progression.
This work, from a markerless video analysis, built a Riemmanian geometry gait representation to analyze principal
geodesic variations and quantify alteration on locomotor patterns. The proposed approach project walking markerless videos
into a bank of deep features. These deep activations are coded into compact covariance matrices, which coexist in a special
Riemmanian manifold. A video gait descriptor is then formulated as the geometric mean and the principal geodesic directions
with greatest variance. These descriptors are finally used in an automatic supervised PD classification task. Experiments
were carried out in a dataset with 22 patients, equally distributed between control and Parkinson�s disease. Following a leaveone-
patient-out cross-validation, the proposed video gait descriptor achieves an average accuracy of 99% and a true positive
rate of 97%. Besides, the resultant geometry descriptor space was projected in a low-dimensional version, as an alternative
to carried out observational gait analysis. This space shows a robust clustering among the evaluated classes. The proposed
approach takes advantage of greatest geodesic variance to quantify abnormal locomotion PD patterns. The validation suggests
that the strategy could be potentially implemented as an alternative to support diagnosis and following of the disease",NC,,

Smartphones can measure PD features, yet no smartphone-derived rating score exists to assess motor symptom severity in real-world settings. Objectives: To develop an objective measure of PD severity and test construct validity by evaluating the ability of the measure to capture intraday symptom fluctuations, correlate with current standard PD outcome measures, and respond to dopaminergic therapy. Design, Setting, and Participants: This observational study assessed individuals with PD who remotely completed 5 tasks (voice, finger tapping, gait, balance, and reaction time) on the smartphone application. We used a novel machine-learning�based approach to generate a mobile Parkinson disease score (mPDS) that objectively weighs features derived from each smartphone activity (eg, stride length from the gait activity) and is scaled from 0 to 100 (where higher scores indicate greater severity). Individuals with and without PD additionally completed standard in-person assessments of PD with smartphone assessments during a period of 6 months. Main Outcomes and Measures: Ability of the mPDS to detect intraday symptom fluctuations, the correlation between the mPDS and standard measures, and the ability of the mPDS to respond to dopaminergic medication. Results: The mPDS was derived from 6148 smartphone activity assessments from 129 individuals (mean [SD] age, 58.7 [8.6] years; 56 [43.4%] women). Gait features contributed most to the total mPDS (33.4%). In addition, 23 individuals with PD (mean [SD] age, 64.6 [11.5] years; 11 [48%] women) and 17 without PD (mean [SD] age 54.2 [16.5] years; 12 [71%] women) completed in-clinic assessments. The mPDS detected symptom fluctuations with a mean (SD) intraday change of 13.9 (10.3) points on a scale of 0 to 100. The measure correlated well with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease�s Rating Scale total (r =?0.81; P <?.001) and part III only (r =?0.88; P <?.001), the Timed Up and Go assessment (r =?0.72; P =?.002), and the Hoehn and Yahr stage (r =?0.91; P <?.001). The mPDS improved by a mean (SD) of 16.3 (5.6) points in response to dopaminergic therapy. Conclusions and Relevance: Using a novel machine-learning approach, we created and demonstrated construct validity of an objective PD severity score derived from smartphone assessments. This score complements standard PD measures by providing frequent, objective, real-world assessments that could enhance clinical care and evaluation of novel therapeutics.""

data during the performance of specific MDS-UPDRS/BFM upper- and lower-limb motor tasks, and
derived data features suitable to estimate clinical scores using machine learning (ML). XDP patients
were at varying stages of disease and clinical severity. ML-based algorithms estimated MDS-UPDRS

In clinical practice, there exist several diagnostic rating scales that coarsely allow the measurement, characteriza- tion and classification of disease progression. These scales, however, are only based on strong changes in kinematic patterns, and the classification remains subjective, depending on the expertise of physicians. In addition, even for experts, disease analysis based on independent classical motor patterns lacks sufficient sensitivity to establish disease progression. Consequently, the disease diagnosis, stage, and progression could be affected by misinterpretations that lead to incorrect or inefficient treatment plans. This work introduces a multimodal non-invasive strategy based on video descriptors that integrate patterns from gait and eye fixation modalities to assist PD quantification and to support the diagnosis and follow-up of the patient. The multimodal representation is achieved from a compact covariance descriptor that char- acterizes postural and time changes of both information sources to improve disease classification. Methods: A multimodal approach is introduced as a computational method to capture movement abnor- malities associated with PD. Two modalities (gait and eye fixation) are recorded in markerless video se- quences. Then, each modality sequence is represented, at each frame, by primitive features composed of (1) kinematic measures extracted from a dense optical flow, and (2) deep features extracted from a con- volutional network. The spatial distributions of these characteristics are compactly coded in covariance matrices, making it possible to map each particular dynamic in a Riemannian manifold. The temporal mean covariance is then computed and submitted to a supervised Random Forest algorithm to obtain a disease prediction for a particular patient. The fusion of the covariance descriptors and eye movements integrating deep and kinematic features is evaluated to assess their contribution to disease quantifica- tion and prediction. In particular, in this study, the gait quantification is associated with typical patterns observed by the specialist, while ocular fixation, associated with early disease characterization, comple- ments the analysis. Results: In a study conducted with 13 control subjects and 13 PD patients, the fusion of gait and ocular fixation, integrating deep and kinematic features, achieved an average accuracy of 100% for early and late fusion. The classification probabilities show high confidence in the prediction diagnosis, the control sub- jects probabilities being lower than 0.27 with early fusion and 0.3 with late fusion, and those of the PD patients, being higher than 0.62 with early fusion and 0.51 with late fusion. Furthermore, it is observed that higher probability outputs are correlated with more advanced stages of the disease, according to the H&Y scale. Conclusions: A novel approach for fusing motion modalities captured in markerless video sequences was introduced. This multimodal integration had a remarkable discrimination performance in a study con- ducted with PD and control patients. The representation of compact covariance descriptors from kinematic and deep features suggests that the proposed strategy is a potential tool to support diagnosis and subsequent monitoring of the disease. During fusion it was observed that devoting major attention to eye fixational patterns may contribute to a better quantification of the disease, especially at stage 2",NC,,

However, these measurements are often not as accurate or reliable as clinical evaluations because it is challenging to objectively distinguish the unique gait characteristics of PD. We explore the inference of patients' stage of PD from their gait using machine learning analyses of data gathered from their smartphone sensors. Specifically, we investigate supervised machine learning (ML) models to classify the severity of the motor part of the UPDRS (MDS-UPDRS 2.10-2.13). Our goals are to facilitate remote monitoring of PD patients and to answer the following questions: (1) What is the patient PD stage based on their gait? (2) Which features are best for understanding and classifying PD gait severities? (3) Which ML classifier types best discriminate PD patients from healthy controls (HC)? and (4) Which ML classifier types can discriminate the severity of PD gait anomalies? Methodology: Our work uses smartphone sensor data gathered from 9520 patients in the mPower study, of whom 3101 participants uploaded gait recordings and 344 subjects and 471 controls uploaded at least 3 walking activities. We selected 152 PD patients who performed at least 3 recordings before and 3 recordings after taking medications and 304 HC who performed at least 3 walking recordings. From the accelerometer and gyroscope sensor data, we extracted statistical, time, wavelet and frequency domain features, and other lifestyle features were derived directly from participants' survey data. We conducted supervised classification experiments using 10-fold cross-validation and measured the model precision, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC). Results: The best classification model, best feature, highest classification accuracy, and AUC were (1) random forest and entropy rate, 93% and 0.97, respectively, for walking balance (MDS-UPDRS-2.12); (2) bagged trees and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.92, respectively, for shaking/tremor (MDS-UPDRS-2.10); (3) bagged trees and entropy rate, 98% and 0.98, respectively, for freeze of gait; and (4) random forest and MinMaxDiff, 95% and 0.99, respectively, for distinguishing PD patients from HC. Conclusion: Machine learning classification was challenging due to the use of data that were subjectively labeled based on patients' answers to the MDS-UPDRS survey questions.

a fully automated deep learning approach was used,

These parameters were fed to five tree-based machine learning algorithms which demonstrated to successfully distinguish Ataxia (following an oversampling step) and PD patients, showing promising metrics, e.g., accuracies and sensitivities up to 81% and 86%. The findings obtained suggest the proposed strategy could drive new research questions in the field and be of direct practical relevance in the clinical setting.

However, many current approaches require the use of multiple devices, or performance of prescribed motor activities, which makes them ill-suited for free-living conditions. Furthermore, there is a lack of open methods that have demonstrated both criterion and discriminative validity for continuous objective assessment of motor symptoms in this population. Hence, there is a need for systems that can reduce patient burden by using a minimal sensor setup while continuously capturing clinically meaningful measures of motor symptom severity under free-living conditions. We propose a method that sequentially processes epochs of raw sensor data from a single wrist-worn accelerometer by using heuristic and machine learning models in a hierarchical framework to provide continuous monitoring of tremor and bradykinesia.

assessment periods. This proof-of-concept study aimed to develop a sensor-based paradigm to detect
and classify tics.
Methods: We recorded both electromyogram and acceleration data from seventeen TS patients, either
when voluntarily moving or experiencing tics and during the modified Rush Video Tic Rating Scale
(mRVTRS). Spectral properties of voluntary and tic movements from the sensor that captured the dominant
tic were calculated and used as features in a support vector machine (SVM) to detect and classify
movements retrospectively.
Results: Across patients, the SVM had an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 96.69 � 4.84%, 98.24 � 4.
79%, and 96.03 � 6.04%, respectively, when classifying movements in the test dataset. Furthermore, each

the tic detection accuracy was 85.63 � 15.28% during the mRVTRS, while overall movement classification

Conclusions: These results demonstrate that wearable sensors can capture physiological differences

disease (PD) based on multilevel indices of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI).
Methods: Ninety-six PD patients, which included thirty-nine postural instability and gait difficulty (PIGD) subtype
and fifty-seven tremor-dominant (TD) subtype, were enrolled and allocated to training and validation datasets
with a ratio of 7:3. A total of five types of index, consisting of mean regional homogeneity (mReHo), mean
amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (mALFF), degree of centrality (DC), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity
(VMHC), and functional connectivity (FC), were extracted. The features were then selected using a twosample
t-test, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and Spearman�s rank correlation
coefficient. Finally, support vector machine (SVM) models based on the separate index and multilevel indices
were built, and the performance of models was assessed via the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUC). Feature importance was evaluated using Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values.
Results: The optimal SVM model was obtained based on multilevel rs-fMRI indices, with an AUC of 0.934 in the
training dataset and an AUC of 0.917 in the validation dataset. The AUCs of the models based on the separate
index were ranged from 0.783 to 0.858 for the training dataset and from 0.713 to 0.792 for the validation

Parkinson's disease defined by episodes when patients show a
complete inability to take a step or continue with their

strategies, including deep brain stimulation, a reliable means of
detecting freezing episodes is required. By using wearable
accelerometers, freezing episodes can be detected with energy-
based algorithms when the ratio of the energy in the freeze band
(3 to 8 Hz) to that of the locomotion band (0.5 to 3 Hz) is above
a patient-specific threshold. However, due to the great
variability in patient activity type, walking style, and freezing

of several clinical manifestations, including the analysis of motor activities. In particular, medical specialists refer to the
MDS-UPDRS (Movement Disorder Society � sponsored revision of Unified Parkinson�s Disease Rating Scale) that is the
most widely used clinical scale for PD rating. However, clinical scales rely on the observation of some subtle motor
phenomena that are either difficult to capture with human eyes or could be misclassified. This limitation motivated
several researchers to develop intelligent systems based on machine learning algorithms able to automatically
recognize the PD. Nevertheless, most of the previous studies investigated the classification between healthy subjects
and PD patients without considering the automatic rating of different levels of severity.
Methods: In this context, we implemented a simple and low-cost clinical tool that can extract postural and kinematic
features with the Microsoft Kinect v2 sensor in order to classify and rate PD. Thirty participants were enrolled for the
purpose of the present study: sixteen PD patients rated according toMDS-UPDRS and fourteen healthy paired subjects.
In order to investigate the motor abilities of the upper and lower body, we acquired and analyzed three main motor
tasks: (1) gait, (2) finger tapping, and (3) foot tapping. After preliminary feature selection, different classifiers based on
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) were trained and evaluated for the best solution.
Results: Concerning the gait analysis, results showed that the ANN classifier performed the best by reaching 89.4% of
accuracy with only nine features in diagnosis PD and 95.0% of accuracy with only six features in rating PD severity.
Regarding the finger and foot tapping analysis, results showed that an SVM using the extracted features was able to
classify healthy subjects versus PD patients with great performances by reaching 87.1% of accuracy. The results of the
classification between mild and moderate PD patients indicated that the foot tapping features were the most
representative ones to discriminate (81.0% of accuracy).
Conclusions: The results of this study have shown how a low-cost vision-based system can automatically detect
subtle phenomena featuring the PD. Our findings suggest that the proposed tool can support medical specialists in

Correspondingly, inertial sensing-based wearable devices (ISWDs) produce objective and standardized quantifications. However, ISWDs indirectly quantify symptoms by parametric modeling of angular velocities and linear accelerations and trained by the judgments of several neurologists through supervised learning algorithms. Hence, the ISWD outputs are biased along with the scores provided by neurologists. To investigate the effectiveness ISWDs for Parkinsonian symptoms quantification, technical verification and clinical validation of both tremor and bradykinesia quantification methods were carried out. A total of 45 Parkinson's disease patients and 30 healthy controls performed the tremor and finger-tapping tasks, which were tracked simultaneously by an ISWD and a 6-axis high-precision electromagnetic tracking system (EMTS). The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) prescribed parameters obtained from the EMTS, which directly provides linear and rotational displacements, were compared with the scores provided by both the ISWD and seven neurologists. EMTS-based parameters were regarded as the ground truth and were employed to train several common machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and random forest (RF) algorithms.

reduced levels of dopamine in the central nervous system. The diagnosis of PD is a difficult and time-consuming
task, and there is no definitive protocol for achieving it. Therefore, several studies have been performed in order
to find reliable PD biomarkers. The analysis of characteristics of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals is one of
the techniques that have been used in the search for biomarkers. EEG signals capture the activity of neurons
through electrodes placed on the scalp and with the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
their characteristics have started to be used in machine learning (ML) algorithms for the automatic diagnosis
of brain diseases, suggesting that EEG signals are promising biomarkers that could be used for automatic
identification of individuals with PD. Thus, this work evaluates the performance of Hjorth features obtained
from electroencephalographic signals, as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. Using the database available at
the public repository called The Patient Repository for EEG Data + Computational Tools (PRED + CT), we
analyzed EEG data from PD individuals periodically exposed to auditory stimuli. The analysis of the proposed
biomarkers showed differences between healthy and PD patients in parietal, frontal, central, and occipital

It is defined as a sudden block in effective stepping, provoking anxiety, stress and falls. FoG is usually evaluated by means of different questionnaires; however, this method has shown to be not reliable, since it is subjective due to its dependence on patients� and caregivers� judgment. Several authors have an- alyzed the usage of MEMS inertial systems to detect FoG with the aim of objectively evaluating it. So far, specific methods based on accelerometer�s frequency response has been employed in many works; nonetheless, since they have been developed and tested in laboratory conditions, their performance is commonly poor when being used at patients� home.

As PD progresses, the affected person is unable to control movement normally. Individuals affected by Parkinson's disease exhibit notable symptoms like gait impairments and tremor occurrences during different stages of the disease. In this paper a novel approach has been proposed to diagnose PD using the gait analysis, that consists of the gait cycle, which can be broken down into various phases and periods to determine normative and abnormal gait. Initially, the raw force data obtained from physionet database was filtered using a Chebyshev type II high pass filter with a cut-off frequency 0.8 Hz to remove noises arising from the changes in orientation of the subject's body and other factors during measurement. The filtered data was used for extracting various gait features using the peak detection and pulse duration measuring techniques. The threshold values of the gait detection algorithm were tuned to individual subjects. From the peak detection algorithm, various kinetic features including the heel and toe forces, and their normalized values were obtained. The pulse duration algorithm was developed to extract different temporal features including the stance and swing phases, and stride time. Tremor is a common symptom in PD. Tremor is an involuntary movement of body parts. At first the tremor may appear in a specific body part like an arm, leg or one side of the body and later it may spread to both sides. This rest tremor is a cardinal sign of PD. An average accuracy of 92.7% is achieved for the diagnosis of PD from gait analysis and tremor analysis is used for knowing the severity of PD.",IC,,

In this study, we investigated the influence of individual model training on short timescale classification of naturalistic bradykinesia fluctuations in Parkinson�s patients using a single-wrist accelerometer. As part of the Parkinson@Home study protocol, 20 Parkinson patients were recorded with bilateral wrist accelerometers for a one hour OFF medication session and a one hour ON medication session during unconstrained activities in their own homes. Kinematic metrics were extracted from the accelerometer data from the bodyside with the largest unilateral bradykinesia fluctuations across medication states. The kinematic accelerometer features were compared over the 1 h duration of recording, and medication-state classification analyses were performed on 1 min segments of data. Then, we analyzed the influence of individual versus group model training, data window length, and total number of training patients included in group model training, on classification. Statistically significant areas under the curves (AUCs) for medication induced bradykinesia fluctuation classification were seen in 85% of the Parkinson patients at the single minute timescale using the group models.

intention to walk. Appearing mostly in mid-late stage Parkinson's disease (PD), freezing
manifests as a sudden loss of lower-limb function, and is closely linked to falling, decreased
functional mobility, and loss of independence.
Wearable-sensor based devices can detect freezes aLogReady in progress, and intervene by
delivering auditory, visual, or tactile stimuli called cues. Cueing has been shown to reduce
FOG duration and allow walking to continue. However, FOG detection and cueing systems
require data from the freeze episode itself and are thus unable to prevent freezing. Anticipating
the FOG episode before onset and supplying a timely cue could prevent the freeze from
occurring altogether.
FOG has been predicted in offline analyses by training machine learning models to
identify wearable-sensor signal patterns known to precede FOG. The most commonly used
sensors for FOG detection and prediction are inertial measurement units (IMU) that include an
accelerometer, gyroscope and sometimes magnetometer. Currently, the best FOG prediction
systems use data collected from multiple sensors on various body locations to develop person-
specific models. Multi-sensor systems are more complex and may be challenging to integrate
into real-life assistive devices. The ultimate goal of FOG prediction systems is a user-friendly
assistive device that can be used by anyone experiencing FOG. To achieve this goal, person-
independent models with high FOG prediction performance and a minimal number of
conveniently located sensors are needed.
The objectives of this thesis were: to develop and evaluate FOG detection and
prediction models using IMU and plantar pressure data; determine if event-based or period of
gait disruption FOG definitions have better classification performance for FOG detection and
prediction; and evaluate FOG prediction models that use a single unilateral plantar pressure
insole sensor or bilateral sensors.
In this thesis, IMU (accelerometer and gyroscope) and plantar pressure insole sensors
were used to collect data from 11 people with FOG while they walked a freeze provoking path.
v
A custom-made synchronization and labeling program was used synchronize the IMU and
plantar pressure data and annotate FOG episodes. Data were divided into overlapping 1 s
windows with 0.2 s shift between consecutive windows. Time domain, Fourier transform
based, and wavelet transform based features were extracted from the data. A total of 861
features were extracted from each of the 71,000 data windows.
To evaluate the effectiveness of FOG detection and prediction models using plantar
pressure and IMU data features, three feature sets were compared: plantar pressure, IMU, and
both plantar pressure and IMU features. Minimum-redundancy maximum-relevance (mRMR)
and Relief-F feature selection were performed prior to training boosted ensembles of decision
trees.
The binary classification models identified Total-FOG or Non-FOG states, wherein the
Total-FOG class included windows with data from 2 s before the FOG onset until the end of
the FOG episode. The plantar-pressure-only model had the greatest sensitivity, and the IMU-
only model had the greatest specificity. The best overall model used the combination of plantar
pressure and IMU features, achieving 76.4% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity.
Next, the Total-FOG class components were evaluated individually (i.e., Pre-FOG
windows, freeze windows, and transition windows between Pre-FOG and FOG). The best
model, which used plantar pressure and IMU features, detected windows that contained both
Pre-FOG and FOG data with 85.2% sensitivity, which is equivalent to detecting FOG less than
1 s after the freeze began. Models using both plantar pressure and IMU features performed
better than models that used either sensor type alone.
Datasets used to train machine learning models often generate ground truth FOG labels
based on visual observation of specific lower limb movements (event-based definition) or an
overall inability to walk effectively (period of gait disruption based definition). FOG definition
ambiguity may affect FOG detection and prediction model performance, especially with
respect to multiple FOG in rapid succession. This research examined the effects of defining
FOG either as a period of gait disruption (merging successive FOG), or based on an event (no
merging), on FOG detection and prediction. Plantar pressure and lower limb acceleration data
were used to extract a set of features and train decision tree ensembles. FOG was labeled using
vi
an event-based definition. Additional datasets were then produced by merging FOG that
occurred in rapid succession. A merging threshold was introduced where FOG that were
separated by less than the merging threshold were merged into one episode. FOG detection
and prediction models were trained for merging thresholds of 0, 1, 2, and 3 s. Merging had
little effect on FOG detection model performance; however, for the prediction model, merging
resulted in slightly later FOG identification and lower precision. FOG prediction models may
benefit from using event-based FOG definitions and avoiding merging multiple FOG in rapid
succession.
Despite the known asymmetry of PD motor symptom manifestation, the difference
between the more severely affected side (MSS) and less severely affected side (LSS) is rarely
considered in FOG detection and prediction studies. The additional information provided by
the MSS or LSS, if any, may be beneficial to FOG prediction models, especially if using a
single sensor. To examine the effect of using data from the MSS, LSS, or both limbs, multiple
FOG prediction models were trained and compared. Three datasets were created using plantar
pressure data from the MSS, LSS, and both sides together. Feature selection was performed,
and FOG prediction models were trained using the top 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 or 30 features for each
dataset. The best models were the MSS model with 15 features, and the LSS and bilateral
features with 5 features. The LSS model reached the highest sensitivity (79.5%) and identified
the highest percentage of FOG episodes (94.9%). The MSS model achieved the highest
specificity (84.9%) and the lowest false positive (FP) rate (2 FP/walking trial). Overall, the
bilateral model was best. The bilateral model had 77.3% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, and
identified 94.3% of FOG episodes an average of 1.1 s before FOG onset. Compared to the
bilateral model, the LSS model had a higher false positive rate; however, the bilateral and LSS
models were similar in all other evaluation metrics. Therefore, using the LSS model instead of
the bilateral model would produce similar FOG prediction performance at the cost of slightly
more false positives. Given the advantages of single sensor systems, the increased FP rate may
be acceptable. Therefore, a single plantar pressure sensor placed on the LSS could be used to
develop a FOG prediction system and produce performance similar to a bilateral system.",NC,,"Thigh, Ankle"

by the production of Lewy bodies in the brain, resulting in the degeneration of dopaminer-
gic nigrostriatal neurons. A common and debilitating symptom of PD is Freezing of Gait
(FoG), which is described as a sudden, episodic inability to make forward progress while
walking despite the intention to do so. FoG can lead to falls and difficulties in everyday
tasks, especially mobility. Conventional PD treatments have a variable impact on miti-
gating FoG due to large heterogeneity within the freezing population, necessitating active
monitoring of an individual�s FoG severity. This study aims to aid the development of ac-
tive FoG severity monitoring using wearable sensors and machine learning. Specifically, it
explores the ternary (3-class) domain of FOG classification (akinetic, kinetic, and no FoG),
which has not been extensively studied before. Specific objectives of this thesis comprises
of: identifying suitable datasets, selecting and optimizing machine learning models, evalu-
ating model performance on participants, and identifying potential applications based on
observed results.
Two datasets were considered for this study, including the Sydney dataset collected by Goh
et al. at the University of Sydney in Australia, and the publicly-available MJFF dataset
comprising multiple collections of data from various groups. The Sydney dataset consists
of 10 participants completing the Ziegler protocol in their �ON� and �OFF� medication
states while equipped with a tri-axial inertial measurement unit (IMU) on their sternum,
lumbar, and bilateral feet. Throughout this dataset, there was a total of 24.9% of the time
spent in an akinetic freeze and 8.87% of the time spent in a kinetic freeze. As for the
MJFF dataset, it was comprised of 100 participants completing a similar Ziegler protocol
and an alternative DeFOG protocol in the two medication states with a lumbar tri-axial
accelerometer. In total, there were 833 trials for the Zeigler protocol in this dataset, and
91 trials for the DeFOG protocol, combining to produce a total of 1.47% of the time spent
in an akinetic freeze and 12.39% of the time spent in a kinetic freeze states.
For classification models, a total of seven architectures were considered, including six clas-
iii
sical models and one deep network model. The classical models received input in the form
of feature vectors, whereas the deep model utilized frequency domain signals along with
a convolutional network backbone to extract information. The features included in this
study were selected from establishing an initial pool, then trimming the included features
down using common feature engineering techniques such as Kendalls correlation, and Min-
imum Redundancy - Maximum Relevance (mRMR). Additionally, all models went through
a randomized grid search for the optimal hyperparameters and architecture parameters to
optimize performance on the utilized datasets.
Testing the models with the participant data in the Sydney dataset revealed that all
classical models and the deep network model encountered challenges in ternary FoG clas-
sification compared to results in the current literature. While some models performed
well for a subset of participants, mainly severe freezers, the majority of the classifiers
struggled to accurately label ternary FoG bouts with many F1-scores falling below 40%.
The top-performing classical model, logistic regression (LogR), faced difficulties in classify-
ing kinetic freezing and temporal accuracy. It was theorized these difficulties arose due to
limited frequency domain features in the final feature set, and limited information about
neighbouring windows when making inferences. While the deep model also struggled with
correctly classifying the timing of the bout, to a larger extent, it had trouble differentiating
between akinetic and kinetic freezing. This drop in performance is likely attributable to
freeze states not achieving steady state, and/or the large heterogeneity within the popu-
lation producing in manifesting akinetic and kinetic freezing (e.g., some akinetic freezes
might have movement, while others are purely akinetic with no movement at all).
When FoG onsets and offsets were not considered, both models demonstrated better per-
formance in classifying severity, with the LogR model predicting correct severity for seven
out of ten individuals and achieving an F1-score of 76% in akinetic freezing and correctly
predicting six out of ten individuals and achieving an F1-score of 60% in kinetic freez-
ing. The deep model correctly classified the combined total severity (akinetic and kinetic
percentages combined) for seven out of ten individuals and achieved an F1-score of 58%.

The findings of this thesis indicate that existing models face challenges in automatically
detecting ternary FoG labels. Further exploration of feature pools and architectures is
warranted to enhance performance in free-living applications. Post-calibration techniques
on model outputs or combining models in a majority voting system are recommended.
Ultimately, this study suggests that the current use of ternary FoG classification may be
better suited for severity estimates or as an annotation tool for clinicians, rather than a
gold standard for free-living labels. More specifically, the models could be used to provide
severity estimates in free-living conditions. These estimates could be later combined with
in-clinic visits to gain a deeper understanding of an individual�s disease progression. Al-
ternatively, actual FoG bout classification can serve as a tool to expedite annotators by
flagging areas of interest prior to a manual confirmation process.",NC,,"Forehead, Sternum, Lumbar, Bilateral Shank, Foot"

Ma- chine learning (ML) techniques have been used in the early prediction of PD progression. Fusion of het- erogeneous data modalities proved its capability to improve the performance of ML models. Time series data fusion supports the tracking of the disease over time. In addition, the trustworthiness of the result- ing models is improved by adding model explainability features. The literature on PD has not sufficiently explored these three points. Methods: In this work, we proposed an ML pipeline for predicting the progression of PD that is both accurate and explainable. We explore the fusion of different combinations of five time series modalities from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) real-world dataset, including patient charac- teristics, biosamples, medication history, motor, and non-motor function data. Each patient has six visits. The problem has been formulated in two ways: ?a three-class based progression prediction with 953 patients in each time series modality, and ?a four-class based progression prediction with 1,060 pa- tients in each time series modality. The statistical features of these six visits were calculated from each modality and diverse feature selection methods were applied to select the most informative feature sets. The extracted features were used to train a set of well-known ML models including Support vector ma- chines (SVM), random forests (RF), extra tree classifier (ETC), light gradient boosting machines (LGBM), and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We examined a number of data-balancing strategies in the pipeline with different combinations of modalities. ML models have been optimized using the Bayesian optimizer. A comprehensive evaluation of various ML methods has been conducted, and the best models have been extended to provide different explainability features. Results: We compare the performance of ML models before and after optimization and using and with- out using feature selection. In the three-class experiment and with various modality fusions, the LGBM model produced the most accurate results with a 10-fold cross-validation (10-CV) accuracy of 90.73% us- ing non-motor function modality. RF produced the best results in the four-class experiment with various modality fusions with a 10-CV accuracy of 94.57% using non-motor modality. With the fused dataset of non-motor and motor function modalities, the LGBM model outperformed the other ML models in both the 3-class and 4-class experiments (i.e., 10-CV accuracy of 94.89% and 93.73%, respectively). Using the Shapely Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework, we employed global and instance-based explanations to explain the behavior of each ML classifier. Moreover, we extended the explainability by implement- ing the LIME and SHAPASH local explainers. The consistency of these explainers has been explored. The resultant classifiers were accurate, explainable, and thus medically more relevant and applicable.",NC,,

Preliminary data collection for the project began almost 10 years ago. The current study is nearing completion of its third year, and has aLogReady reported several novel and important results. First, surprisingly, at least 90% of children who had experienced tics for only a mean of 3 months still had tics at the 12-month anniversary of their first tic, though in some cases tics were seen only with remote video observation of the child sitting alone. Thus almost all of them now had a DSM-5 diagnosis of Tourette�s Disorder or Persistent (Chronic) Tic Disorder. Baseline clinical features that predicted 12-month outcome included tic severity, subsyndromal autism spectrum symptoms, an anxiety disorder, and a history of 3 or more phonic tics. Second, we found that poorer tic suppression ability when immediately rewarded for suppression predicted greater tic severity at follow-up. Third, striatal volumes did not predict outcome as hypothesized, but a larger hippocampus at baseline predicted worse severity at follow-up.

over development. Whether and how brain function in TS also differs across development has been largely understudied.
Here, we used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging to examine whole-brain functional
networks in children and adults with TS.
METHODS: Multivariate classification methods were used to find patterns among functional connections that
distinguish individuals with TS from control subjects separately for children and adults (N = 202). We tested whether
the patterns of connections that classify diagnosis in one age group (e.g., children) could classify diagnosis in another
age group (e.g., adults). We also tested whether the developmental trajectory of these connections was altered in TS.
RESULTS: Diagnostic classification was successful in children and adults separately but expressly did not generalize
across age groups, suggesting that the patterns of functional connections that best distinguished individuals with TS
from control subjects were age specific. Developmental patterns among these functional connections used for
diagnostic classification deviated from typical development. Brain networks in childhood TS appeared �older� and
brain networks in adulthood TS appeared �younger� in comparison with typically developing individuals.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that brain networks are differentially altered in children and adults with TS.
The observed developmental trajectory of affected connections is consistent with theories of accelerated and/or
delayed maturation, but may also involve anomalous developmental pathways. These findings further our understanding
of neurodevelopmental trajectories in TS and carry implications for future applications aimed at predicting
the clinical course of TS in individuals over development",NC,,

This paper evaluates a machine learning method that analyses the signals provided by a triaxial accelerometer placed on the waist of PD patients in order to automatically assess bradykinetic gait unobtrusively. This method employs Support Vector Machines to determine those parts of the signals corresponding to gait. The frequency content of strides is then used to determine bradykinetic walking bouts and to estimate bradykinesia severity based on an epsilon-Support Vector Regression model. The method is validated in 12 PD patients, which leads to two main conclusions. Firstly, the frequency content of the strides allows for the dichotomic detection of bradykinesia with an accuracy higher than 90%. This process requires the use of a patient-dependant threshold that is estimated based on a leave-one-patient-out regression model. Secondly, bradykinesia severity measured through UPDRS scores is approximated by means of a regression model with errors below 10%.

Neurologists typically perform faceto-
face bradykinesia assessment in PD patients according to the Movement Disorder Society-sponsored revision
of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). As this human-expert assessment lacks objectivity
and consistency, an automated and objective assessment scheme for bradykinesia is critically needed. In this
paper, we propose a tree-structure-guided graph convolutional network with contrastive learning scheme to
solve the challenge of difficulty in fine-grained feature extraction and insufficient model stability, finally
achieving the video-based automated assessment of Parkinsonian hand movements, which represent a vital MDSUPDRS
component for examining upper-limb bradykinesia. Specifically, a tri-directional skeleton tree scheme is
proposed to achieve effective fine-grained modeling of spatial hand dependencies. In this scheme, hand skeletons
are extracted from videos, and then the spatial structures of these skeletons are constructed through depth-first
tree traversal. Afterwards, a tree max-pooling module is employed to establish remote exchange between outer
and inner nodes, hierarchically gather the most salient motion features, and hence achieve fine-grained mining.
Finally, a group-sparsity-induced momentum contrast is also developed to learn similar motion patterns under
different interference through contrastive learning. This can promote stable learning of discriminative spatialtemporal
features with invariant motion semantics. Comprehensive experiments on a large clinical video dataset
reveal that our method achieves competitive results, and outperforms other sensor-based and RGB-depth
methods. The proposed method leads to accurate assessment of PD bradykinesia through videos collected by
low-cost consumer cameras of limited capabilities. Hence, our work provides a convenient tool for PD telemedicine
applications with modest hardware requirements.",NC,,

and pattern analysis of neck muscle boundaries to inform
and monitor treatment of cervical dystonia. Methods:
We recorded transverse cervical ultrasound (US) images
and whole-body motion analysis of sixty-one standing
participants (35 cervical dystonia, 26 age matched
controls). We manually annotated 3,272 US images
sampling posture and the functional range of pitch,
yaw, and roll head movements. Using previously validated
methods, we used 60-fold cross validation to train, validate
and test a deep neural network (U-net) to classify pixels to
13 categories (?ve paired neck muscles, skin, ligamentum
nuchae, vertebra). For all participants for their normal
standing posture, we segmented US images and classi?ed
condition (Dystonia/Control), sex and age (higher/lower)
from segment boundaries. We performed an explanatory,
visualization analysis of dystonia muscle-boundaries.
Results: For all segments, agreement with manual labels
was Dice Coef?cient (64 � 21%) and Hausdorff Distance
(5.7 � 4 mm). For deep muscle layers, boundaries predicted
central injection sites with average precision 94 � 3%.
Using leave-one-out cross-validation, a support-vector-
machine classi?ed condition, sex, and age from predicted
muscle boundaries at accuracy 70.5%, 67.2%, 52.4% respectively, exceeding classi?cation by manual labels.
From muscle boundaries, Dystonia clustered optimally
into three sub-groups. These sub-groups are visualized
and explained by three eigen-patterns which correlate
signi?cantly with truncal and head posture. Conclusion:
Using US, neck muscle shape alone discriminates dystonia
from healthy controls. Signi?cance: Using deep learning,
US imaging allows online, automated visualization, and
diagnostic analysis of cervical dystonia and segmentation
of individual muscles for targeted injection.",NC,,

Here, an alternative and objective method will be proposed to assist physicians who diagnose PwMS in the early stages. Methods: A total of 406 static bipedal pressure distribution image data for 43 ataxic PwMS and 62 healthy individuals were used in the study. After preprocessing, these images were given as input to pre-trained deep learning models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NasNetMobile. The data of each model is utilized to generate its feature vectors. Finally, feature vectors obtained from static pressure distribution images were classified by SVM (Support Vector Machine), K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors), and ANN (Artificial Neural Network). In addition, a cross-validation method was used to examine the validity of the classifier. Results: The performance of the proposed models was evaluated with accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-measure criteria. The VGG19-SVM hybrid model showed the best performance with 95.12% acc, 94.91% sen, 95.31% spe, and 94.44% F1. Conclusions: In this study, a specific and sensitive automatic test evaluation system was proposed for Ataxic syndromes using digital images to observe the motor skills of the subjects. Comparative results show that the proposed method can be applied in practice for ataxia that is clinically difficult to detect or not yet symptomatic. It can be defined using only static plantar pressure distribution in the early stage and it can be recommended as an assistant system to physicians in clinical practice.",IC,,

In this research, an ML approach is optimized with the use of Spatio-Temporal data obtained from a kinect-sensor to differentiate between normal gait and ataxic. The current ML-based approaches perform very poorly because they cannot build feature-correlation among many gait characteristics. Furthermore, current ML-based techniques generate more false-positive whenever data is imbalanced in nature; especially for performing multi-label classification. This work presents a feature selection and ranking (FSR) based on extreme gradient boost (XGB) for ataxia severity classification. The FSR-XGB introduce an enhanced misclassification minimization error optimization and presents a novel feature selection and ranking to introduce feature importance using new cross-validation mechanism, both of which are aimed at solving the multilabel classification research problems. Results from experiments demonstrate that the presented FSR-XGB approach outperforms other ML-based and deep learning-based approaches.",IC,,

Quantitative gait analysis can provide valuable insights for PD diagnosis and monitoring. Prior work has utilized 3D motion capture, foot pressure sensors, IMUs, etc. to assess the severity of gait impairment in PD patients These sensors, despite their high precision, are often expensive and cumbersome to wear which makes them not the best option for long-term monitoring and naturalistic deployment settings. In this paper, we introduce mP-Gait, a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar-based system designed to detect the gait features in PD patients and predict the severity of their gait impairment. Leveraging the high frequency and wide bandwidth of mmWave radar signals, mP-Gait is able to capture high-resolution reflected signals from different body parts during walking. We develop a pipeline to detect walking, extract gait features using signal analysis methods, and predict patients� UPDRS-III gait scores with a machine learning model. As gait features from PD patients with gait impairment are correctly and robustly extracted, mP-Gait is able to observe the fine-grained gait impairment severity fluctuation caused by medication response. To evaluate mP-Gait, we collected gait features from 144 participants (with UPDRS-III gait scores between 0 and 2) containing over 4000 gait cycles. Our results show that mP-Gait can achieve a mean absolute error of 0.379 points in predicting UPDRS-III gait scores.",IC,,

In clinical routine and research the severity of the gait disturbances is assessed within a well-established clinical scale and graded into categorial levels. Sensor-free motion registration and subsequent movement analysis allowed to overcome the obvious shortcoming of such coarse grading: Using time series models (tsfresh, ROCKET) we were not only able to successfully reproduce the categorial scaling (Human performance: 44.88% F1-score; our model: 80.28% F1-score). Particularly subtle, early gait disturbances and longitudinal progression below the perception threshold of the human examiner could be captured (Pearson's correlation coefficient human performance-0.060, not significant; our model:-0.626, p < 0.01). Furthermore, SHAP analysis allowed to identify the most important features for each clinical level of gait deterioration. This could further improve the sensitivity to capture longitudinal changes tailored to the pre-existing level of gait disturbances (Pearson's correlation coefficients up to-0.988, p < 0.01). In conclusion, the ML-based analysis could significantly improve the sensitivity in the assessment of gait disturbances in ataxia patients. Thus, it qualifies as a potential digital outcome parameter for early interventions, therapy monitoring, and home recordings.",IC,Preprint. Not peer-reviewed,
